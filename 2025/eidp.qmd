## What Is the E-IDP?

The Entrepreneurial Individual Development Plan (E-IDP) is a tool to help you grow professionally throughout this course. Itâ€™s based on the idea that entrepreneurship is not just about launching a businessâ€”itâ€™s about cultivating a mindset and a set of core competencies that apply across professional settings.

You will use the E-IDP to:

- Reflect on your entrepreneurial strengths and areas for growth
- Track your development over the semester
- Receive feedback from mentors based on real-world interaction
- Identify habits or patterns that support or inhibit your success

This is also the tool your mentor will use to get to know you and support your development. Youâ€™ll complete a **self-assessment at the beginning and end of the course**, using the characteristics below as your guide. Mentors will also give feedback on your development mid-semester and at the end of the semester.

ðŸ‘‰ [View Mentor Instructions](mentor-instructions.qmd) to understand what they'll see.

## Entrepreneurial Characteristics

The table below includes 42 personal characteristics associated with entrepreneurial success. These are drawn from Kuratko's *Entrepreneurship: Theory, Process, and Practice* (11th Edition), and youâ€™ll use them to shape your self-assessment and reflection throughout the course.

Each characteristic can be rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high) in terms of how much it describes you **right now**. The goal is not to score perfectly, but to notice where youâ€™re growing.

## How You'll Use This

- **Week 1**: Complete your baseline self-assessment using a form provided on Canvas.
- **Mid-Semester**: Your mentor will complete a short evaluation based on their interactions with you.
- **End of Semester**: Complete your final self-assessment and submit a reflection comparing your growth over time.

You can use this data to write your final reflection or even include in future job materials (e.g. internship reflections, personal statements, cover letters).



## Why It Matters

Entrepreneurship is not just about starting businessesâ€”it's about being someone who takes initiative, solves problems creatively, and works well with others to turn ideas into action.

The E-IDP is designed to help you **notice how you grow**, and give you structured support along the way.
