# Part 2: <br> Major Types of Entrepreneurial Ventures

## There are four main types of entrepreneurial ventures.

- Survival ventures
- Lifestyle ventures
- Managed growth ventures
- Aggressive growth ventures

## Survival Venture

These ventures are started out of necessity and usually generate just enough income to support the e_____________ and their household.



## Example: **L__ P______** 

Started as a food truck serving Italian flatbreads in Fort Collins, launched by two founders with a passion for bringing Romagna-style street food to the area. 

Initially operated with limited staff and resources, focusing on local events and markets.

Represents a grassroots approach to e_______________, often with family labor and a bootstrapped budget.

Over time, the business grew into a permanent brick-and-mortar location ‚Äî a transition that many survival ventures aspire to.



## Lifestyle Venture

These ventures prioritize personal goals over business growth, often aligning with a preferred way of living.

Income is stable and sufficient, but growth is not the main objective.


## Example: **J____ F_____** 

A pasture-raised poultry and egg farm just outside Fort Collins, selling direct-to-consumer and at local farmers‚Äô markets. 

Focuses on sustainable practices and local relationships over aggressive scaling.

Supports a lifestyle of land stewardship, food quality, and local identity.


## Managed Growth Venture

These businesses aim for moderate and steady growth, often by formalizing operations and expanding reach.


## Example: **S______, an A.M. Eatery** 

Founded in Denver as a single breakfast spot and grew into a regional chain with sustainability commitments and community engagement baked into its business model.

Combines professional management and expansion with intentional values (e.g., waste reduction, local sourcing).

Uses operational scale but avoids a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù model.


## Aggressive Growth Venture

These are high-growth, scalable businesses that often seek venture capital or rapid market expansion.

Emphasizes innovation, rapid scaling, and market disruption.



## Example: **P_____** 

A vertical farming startup based in San Francisco using robotics and AI to grow leafy greens in indoor controlled environments.

Backed by SoftBank, Jeff Bezos, and others; positioned to disrupt traditional ag supply chains.


## Special Case of Agressive Growth Ventures: *G_______*

- A business establishment with at least ____ percent sales growth in each year for 5 years, starting with a base of at least $____,____ in annual sales.
- G_______ as leaders in innovation:
  - Median growth of ____ percent
  - Top-performing 1 percent of companies account for about ____ percent of jobs.
  - G_______ make up less than 1 percent of all businesses and account for ____ percent of net new jobs.


::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Mythology Associated with G_______"}
- G_______ are the goal of all e______________.
- G_______ receive venture capital.
- G_______ were never mice.
- G_______ are high tech.
- G_______ are global.
::: 

## Special Case of Agressive Growth Ventures: *U________*

- A pre-IPO^[IPO="Initial Public Offering"] (private) tech start-up company with a $1 billion market value.
- In ____, 1,____ start-ups were U________.

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="D_________ and H__________"}
- A ‚Äúdecacorn‚Äù
  - Start-ups with a $____ billion or more market value.
  - Examples: Facebook, Uber (taxis), and Airbnb (hotels)
- A ‚Äúhectacorn‚Äù is valued at $____ billion or more.
::: 


## The Case of P_____

After raising $1B in funding, P_____ filed for bankruptcy in March ____.


However, the company has re-emerged after company restructuring (as of May ____).  
[Read the PR Newswire article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/P_____-undertakes-restructuring-process-to-support-focus-on-premium-strawberry-market-____.html)



## What Bankruptcy Means for P_____

| **What it Means**         | **Details**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Out of cash**           | P_____ can no longer meet its financial obligations (e.g., rent, salaries, supplier payments). |
| **Court protection**      | Bankruptcy gives the company legal protection from creditors while it reorganizes its finances. |
| **Debts frozen**          | Debt collection is paused, giving the company time to develop a recovery or liquidation plan. |
| **Equity holders lose**   | Investors (like SoftBank, Bezos Expeditions) may lose most or all of their investment. |
| **Restructuring**         | The company may sell off assets, renegotiate contracts, lay off workers, or change its business model. |


## What Bankruptcy for P_____ Tells Us About Agribusiness Startups

P_____ raised nearly **$1 billion** in venture capital and still went bankrupt. That highlights:

- **High capital intensity**: Vertical farming requires massive investment in infrastructure, energy, and automation.  
- **Scale ‚â† success**: Being a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù (valued over $1B) doesn‚Äôt guarantee product-market fit or profitability.  
- **Unit economics matter**: If the cost to grow and deliver produce exceeds what consumers will pay, it‚Äôs not sustainable.  
- **Supply chain complexity**: Even with tech and AI, perishable products and logistics remain challenging.  
- **Vulnerability to macro forces**: Energy costs, inflation, labor, and competition can undermine a well-funded startup.

## Entrepreneurial Ventures in the United States

Reasons for the exceptional entrepreneurial activity in the United States include:

  - A national culture that supports risk-taking and -seeking opportunities.
  - Americans‚Äô alertness to unexploited economic opportunity and a low fear of failure.
  - U.S. leadership in E_______________ education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
  - A high percentage of individuals with professional, technological, or business degrees who are likely to become e______________.

## Why Economists are Interested in E_______________

New ventures can change the market structure by shifting supply or introducing entirely new supply curves, as well as generate demand. 

This happens via:

- Market entry and exit
- Pricing and competition
- Consumer access and innovation



::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Entrepreneurial Firms‚Äô Economic Impact"}

# Part 3: <br> Cultivating an Entrepreneurial Mindset

## Origins of E_______________

- E_____________ is derived from the French *entreprendre*, meaning ‚Äúto undertake.‚Äù
- The e_____________ is **one who undertakes** to organize, manage, and assume the risks of a business.
- Although no single definition of e_____________ exists and no one profile can represent today‚Äôs e______________, research is providing an increasingly sharper focus on the subject.

## E______________ are Breakthrough Innovators

- Boomerpreneurs: age ____ or older
  - Believe their business has had a positive social impact.

- Among millennials, ____ percent say their goal involves starting their own business.
- Among Generation Z, ____ percent hope to run their own businesses within ____ years.

## E_______________: A Mindset

E_______________ is more than the mere creation of business. 

It is a *mindset* where one:

- Seeks opportunities.
- Takes risks beyond security.
- Has the tenacity to push an idea through to reality.

**E_______________ is an integrated concept that permeates an individual‚Äôs business in an innovative manner.**


## The Entrepreneurial Process: <br> Employee vs. E_____________ Mindset

- Becoming on e_____________ is less about the money, the commitment, or the support and **more about the mindset.** 

- It revolves around shifting from an employee mindset to an e_____________ mindset. 

**The more a person can change their mindset from employee to e_____________, the more they will be able to find satisfaction in e_______________.**

## The Entrepreneurial Mindset Transformation

- E_______________ is more than just creating a business; it is an actual spiritual and emotional transformation that takes you from on established way of thinking to a new, groundbreaking mentality. 

- An e_____________ must get comfortable with being uncomfortable and be able to deal with fear. 

- E_______________, in whatever capacity or form it shows itself in, is risky and fear inducing. 

- It does not matter if you are selling lemonade in your backyard as a kid, writing your first book, or hustling to market your brand after hours.

# Summary Description of E_______________

## Our working definition of "E_______________"

**E_______________** is...

- The dynamic process of creating incremental wealth through vision, change, and creation
- This wealth is created by individuals who assume major risks in terms of equity, time, and/or career commitment of providing value for a product or service.
- The product or service itself may or may not be new or unique, but the e_____________ must somehow infuse value by securing and allocating the necessary skills and resources.

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Ingredients of E_______________"}

What does it take to be an e_____________?

- Willingness to take calculated risks‚Äîin terms of time, equity, or career
- Ability to formulate an effective venture team
- Creative skill to marshal needed resources
- Fundamental skills of building a solid business plan
- Vision to recognize opportunity where others see chaos, contradiction, and confusion
::: 

## Research on E_______________ seeks to examine all facets of the topic

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="A Framework-of-Frameworks Approach"}
There are different schools of thought and process models that fit into the larger study of E_______________. 

This framework brings together both macro and micro perspectives:

- On the **macro side**, it includes external influences like culture, capital access, and economic conditions (i.e., things outside the e_____________‚Äôs control).

- On the **micro side**, it focuses on internal traits and strategic thinking‚Äîthings like personal motivation, opportunity recognition, and business planning.

- It also includes **process-based** approaches that look at how ventures are formed and evolve over time, emphasizing inputs (like team or resources) and outcomes (like growth or innovation).

<small>*Rather than detailing each school here, I encourage you to read the corresponding sections in the textbook. It‚Äôs helpful to reference when you start noticing how e______________ are influenced by both their personal traits and their environment ‚Äî and when we explore business cases later in the semester.*</small>
