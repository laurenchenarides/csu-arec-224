Corporations face rapid and unpredictable change.

To compete, they:

## The Need for Corporate Entrepreneurship

Why companies pursue it:\
- New competitors emerging.\
- Traditional management methods distrusted.\

## Corporate Innovation \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Practices that build an innovation-driven company:

1.  **Set \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.** What steps does the employee need to take so that innovation goals are achieved?

2.  **Create a system of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.** How can risk-taking be encouraged within the company?\

3.  **Emphasize individual \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.** Key pillars: confidence, trust, accountability

4.  **Provide \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for innovative ideas.** How can employees be incentivized to put their innovative talents to use?

Practices that build an innovation-driven **class**:

1.  **Set clear innovation goals.**\
    → In class: Your *innovation goal* is to produce a professional podcast episode with your mentor.\
    What smaller steps will get you there? (planning, interviewing, editing)

2.  **Create a system of feedback and positive reinforcement.**\
    → In class: You’ll get feedback from your mentor, peers, and me.\
    How can you encourage each other to take risks and try new approaches?

3.  **Emphasize individual responsibility.**\
    → In class: Each team member has a role in the podcast.\
    How do confidence, trust, and accountability show up in your group?

4.  **Provide rewards for innovative ideas.**\
    → In class: Creative approaches (unique interview angles, strong storytelling) will shine through in your final product and class presentations.

5.  **Don’t punish failure.**\
    → In class: Experiments might not work (tech glitches, awkward questions).\
    How can you turn these into learning moments instead of setbacks?

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="Apply it to your own experience"}
-   How can you practice these five principles in your mentor relationship?\
-   How will experimenting with the podcast help you build confidence in risk-taking and innovation?\
:::

## Quick Poll

Which practice would motivate you most working in an organization?

A. Having clear innovation goals.\
B. Receiving feedback and positive reinforcement.\
C. Being rewarded for innovative ideas.\
D. Having freedom to work independently.\
E. Having guardrails to fail safely.\

## How to Determine if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If you find yourself craving a workplace where entrepreneurial thinking is encouraged, use these questions to determine if your organization supports that mindset:

☐ Does the company encourage entrepreneurial thinking?\
☐ Does the company provide ways for innovators to stay (not abandon) with their ideas?\
☐ Are people in the company permitted to do the job on their own, or are they constantly stopping to explain their actions and ask for permission?\
☐ Has the company evolved quick and informal ways to access the resources to try new ideas?\
☐ Has the company developed ways to manage many small and experimental innovations?\
☐ Is the system set up to encourage risk taking and to tolerate mistakes?\
☐ Are people in our company more concerned with new ideas or with defending their turf?\
☐ How easy is it to form functionally complete, autonomous teams in our corporate environments?\

Alternatively, an innovative corporate environment may be built around the application of rules for innovation.\

This is the result of a **corporate \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** that supports innovative behavior.

## Corporate Entrepreneurship Terms:

## (1) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ vs. (2) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now that we understand the value and culture of entrepreneurship *within* organizations, how do companies actually structure it?

1.  **Adding new businesses** (or portions of new businesses via equity investments) to the corporation
    -   Can take three forms:
        -   *Internal corporate venturing* → new ventures created inside the company\
        -   *Cooperative corporate venturing* → partnerships or joint ventures with other firms\
        -   *External corporate venturing* → investing in startups outside the company

*Example:* Tyson Foods investing in plant-based protein startups.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="*Definition:* __________________ ______________"}
Creating or investing in new businesses within or alongside the corporation to generate growth and innovation.
:::

2.  **Transforming the core business**
    -   Changes to firm strategy, product offerings, served markets, internal organization, or business model

*Example:* General Mills shifting resources toward healthier snack lines to adapt to consumer demand.

## Obstacles to Corporate Entrepreneurship

**Traditional practice → Problem created → Better approach**

| Traditional Practice | Problem It Creates | Better Approach |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Enforcing rigid procedures | Blocks innovation | Make rules flexible for each situation |
| Managing only for efficiency & ROI | Competitive lead lost, weak market presence | Focus effort on critical issues (e.g., market share) |
| Planning for the long term only | Nonviable goals, high costs of failure | Set interim milestones and reassess often |
| Protecting the base business at all costs | Missed opportunities | Take small, affordable risks |
| Promoting only “compatible” individuals | Loss of innovators (“boat rockers”) | Support innovators and risk-takers |

<small> *Note:* These examples are **selected from Table 3.2 in Kuratko (2024)**. See the textbook for the complete list.</small>

## Cultivating Successful Innovative Companies

Factors:

1.  Develop the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
2.  Encourage \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
3.  Structure for an entrepreneurial \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
4.  Prepare \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for corporate innovation\
5.  Develop \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\

# Part 2 <br> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Entrepreneurship

## Setting the Stage

Think of a social cause you care about (local or global).

How could a business help solve it?

## Defining \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Entrepreneurship

-   Mixes nonprofit, government, and business features.\
-   Combines innovation, risk-taking, and large-scale transformation with solving social problems.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="*Definition:* ______________ ______________"}

:::
::::

## Social Entrepreneurship Process

1.  Recognize a social opportunity.\
2.  Translate into an enterprise concept.\
3.  Acquire resources.\
4.  Execute to achieve social impact.

**Social Enterprises**

-   Mission-driven: increase **social value**.\
-   Can be nonprofit or for-profit.\
-   For-profit model: *Buy One, Give One* (e.g., TOMS Shoes).

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="*Definition:* Social Value"}
**Social value** is the positive impact created for society when organizations address community, environmental, or social needs.\
It goes beyond financial profit to include benefits such as improved well-being, reduced inequality, stronger communities, and a healthier environment.
:::

## Companies Built Around a Core Social Mission

**Consumer Brands with Activism**

-   **Ben & Jerry’s** → balances profit with activism on climate and social justice.\
-   **Patagonia Provisions**, **New Belgium Brewing**, **King Arthur Baking** → certified **B Corps**, embedding sustainability and transparency into their business models.\
-   **Unilever** → large-scale sustainability initiatives in agriculture and packaging.\

**Food Access & Waste Reduction**

-   **Misfits Market** → sells “imperfect” produce at discount, reducing food waste and improving affordability.\

**Global Social Ventures**

-   **Water for People** → expands clean water access worldwide.\
-   **Sanergy** → builds affordable sanitation systems in Kenya.\
-   **The Clothing Bank** → trains women in South Africa for entrepreneurship and financial independence.\

## Benefit Corporations (B Corps)

-   **Purpose**: positive social/environmental impact\
-   **Accountability**: consider stakeholders (workers, community, environment)\
-   **Transparency**: annual reporting\
-   **Certification**: Verified by [**B Lab**](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification/)

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="How certification works"}
1.  Complete the **B Impact Assessment** (covers governance, workers, community, environment, customers).\
2.  Score at least **80 out of 200 points**.\
3.  Provide documentation and undergo a review/audit by B Lab.\
4.  Amend governing documents to reflect stakeholder accountability.\
5.  Recertify every **3 years**.\
:::

## Shared \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ & \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (TBL)

-   **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** → Business creates economic value **while also solving social or environmental problems**.

    *Example: Nestlé developing fortified foods for low-income markets.*

-   **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (TBL)** → Success measured not just by profit, but by balancing: 

    -   **Profit** (economic performance)\
    -   **People** (social performance)\
    -   **Planet** (environmental performance)

**Why it matters:**

If TBL guides decisions, projects with higher **social and environmental returns** are more likely to get funded, even if short-term profits are lower.

## Measuring Social Impact

If firms claim to create *\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_* or follow the *TBL*, how do we know it’s real?

Impact can be measured in several ways:

-   **Civic wealth / community well-being**\
    → e.g., increase in local jobs, education, resilience

-   **Scale breadth** (reach more people)\
    → e.g., number of households receiving affordable produce

-   **Scale depth** (deepen services to current users)\
    → e.g., improving nutrition or health outcomes for the same group

-   **Extent of social change**\
    → e.g., long-term reduction in food insecurity or child labor

*Takeaway:* Measuring social impact makes TBL and Shared Value **actionable**, not just slogans.

## \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Entrepreneurship

-   Many social ventures launched in the U.S. aim to benefit **developing countries**
    -   e.g., water access, sanitation, sustainable farming, disaster relief\
-   Poverty alleviation through entrepreneurship\
-   Global trade agreements shape opportunities and challenges:
    -   **WTO** (World Trade Organization)\
    -   **USMCA** (U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement)\
    -   **EU** (European Union)\
-   Ways to go international:
    -   Exporting\
    -   International alliances / joint ventures\
    -   Direct foreign investment\
    -   Licensing

## Considerations for Social Entrepreneurs Going Global

Before expanding internationally, social entrepreneurs should evaluate:

::: {style="font-size:85%;"}
| Area | Key Question | Example |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Importing & Exporting** | Are there tariffs, trade restrictions, or infrastructure challenges? | *Misfits Market* explored selling surplus food abroad but faced high logistics costs and strict import regulations. |
| **International Alliances & Joint Ventures** | Who are the trusted local partners that can help adapt the model? | *World Central Kitchen* partners with local chefs and restaurants in disaster zones to scale relief efforts. |
| **Direct Foreign Investment** | What are the risks of owning facilities or operations abroad? | *Oatly* invested in overseas production plants (U.S., Singapore) to meet global demand while maintaining brand consistency. |
| **Licensing** | Can technology, trademarks, or processes be adapted by others? | *Driptech* licensed its low-cost irrigation technology to local distributors to reach smallholder farmers in India and China. |
| **Researching Foreign Markets** | How do local culture, regulations, and consumer needs affect expansion? | *Tony’s Chocolonely* studied European vs. U.S. consumer attitudes toward “fair trade” chocolate before expanding. |
:::

*Takeaway:* Expanding globally is not just about scaling up — it requires adapting the mission to new political, economic, and cultural contexts.

## Group Activity 3-1 {data-background-color="lightblue"}

**Time:** 30 minutes\
**Format:** Work with your pods

**Instructions (23-25 minutes)**

1.  Each group will receive a **scenario** told from the perspective of a founder.\
2.  Spend the first part of the activity discussing:
    -   What is the social problem the founder is trying to solve?\
    -   How should the team define the **social mission** of this enterprise?\
    -   Who is the target community?\
    -   What resources or partnerships will they need?

**Debrief (5–7 minutes)**

-   What did your group define as the **social mission**?\
-   Did different groups emphasize different values (environment, equity, access, resilience)?\
-   What trade-offs did you notice when deciding what mattered most?

## Closing Remarks

-   Corporate entrepreneurship = innovating inside established firms.\
