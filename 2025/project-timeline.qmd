The table below is a week-by-week guide for where you should be in the semester. The **Week** column shows the general time frame, the **What You’ll Do column** lists the main task or milestone to focus on during that period, and the **Why It Matters** column explains how that work connects to your larger projects—your [podcast project](../podcast/podcast-instructions.qmd), [case study discussions](../cases/case-assignment.qmd), and [business case competition](../cases/case-competition). Read it row by row to understand what you should be working on at each stage and how it prepares you for the steps that follow.

| Week      | What You’ll Do                                           | Why It Matters                                                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1–2**   | Learn how to read and talk about case studies.           | You’ll use the same skills when you write your own case later.           |
| **2**     | Get your mentor and pod assignment.                     | This is the group you’ll work with all semester.                         |
| **3–4**   | Start Fishbowl discussions and write weekly reflections. | Practice finding the main challenge in a case and asking good questions. |
| **3–5**   | Meet your mentor and start research.                     | This info will go in the background section of your case.                |
| **4–6**   | Record your podcast episode.                             | The interview will help you find a challenge or decision for your case.  |
| **6–8**   | Finish podcast show notes.                               | Practice summarizing a story clearly — you’ll do this for your case too. |
| **9**     | Write a short paragraph about your case idea.            | Gets your topic approved before you start writing.                       |
| **11**    | Create an outline for your case.                         | Helps you organize the story and find missing details.                   |
| **12–13** | Share your outline with your mentor.                     | They can check that it’s accurate and realistic.                         |
| **14**    | Make slides and practice your presentation.              | You’ll use these for the final competition.                              |
| **15**    | Present your case and turn in all materials.             | This is your final project for the semester.                             |
