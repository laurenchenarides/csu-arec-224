## Major Types of Entrepreneurial Ventures

- Survival ventures
- Lifestyle ventures
- Managed growth ventures
- Aggressive growth ventures

## Survival Venture

These ventures are started out of necessity and usually generate just enough income to support the entrepreneur and their household.

::: {.placeholder}
![Placeholder: Early photo of La Piadina food truck or street vendor setup at a local Fort Collins market.](../images/survival_placeholder.jpg)
:::


## Example: **La Piadina** 

Started as a food truck serving Italian flatbreads in Fort Collins, launched by two founders with a passion for bringing Romagna-style street food to the area. Initially operated with limited staff and resources, focusing on local events and markets.

Represents a grassroots approach to entrepreneurship, often with family labor and a bootstrapped budget.

Over time, the business grew into a permanent brick-and-mortar location ‚Äî a transition that many survival ventures aspire to.



## Lifestyle Venture

These ventures prioritize personal goals over business growth, often aligning with a preferred way of living.

Income is stable and sufficient, but growth is not the main objective.

::: {.placeholder}
![Placeholder: Local farm stand or pasture-raised egg operation in Northern Colorado.](../images/lifestyle_placeholder.jpg)
:::

## Example: **Jodar Farms** 

A pasture-raised poultry and egg farm just outside Fort Collins, selling direct-to-consumer and at local farmers‚Äô markets. Focuses on sustainable practices and local relationships over aggressive scaling.

Supports a lifestyle of land stewardship, food quality, and local identity.


## Managed Growth Venture

These businesses aim for moderate and steady growth, often by formalizing operations and expanding reach.

::: {.placeholder}
![Placeholder: Branded packaging or interior of a Snooze location with emphasis on local vibe and consistent operations.](../images/managed_placeholder.jpg)
:::

## Example: **Snooze, an A.M. Eatery** 

Founded in Denver as a single breakfast spot and grew into a regional chain with sustainability commitments and community engagement baked into its business model.

Combines professional management and expansion with intentional values (e.g., waste reduction, local sourcing).

Uses operational scale but avoids a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù model.



## Aggressive Growth Venture

These are high-growth, scalable businesses that often seek venture capital or rapid market expansion.

Emphasizes innovation, rapid scaling, and market disruption.

::: {.placeholder}
![Placeholder: High-tech vertical farm or AI-controlled ag facility.](../images/aggressive_placeholder.jpg)
:::

## Example: **Plenty** 

A vertical farming startup based in San Francisco using robotics and AI to grow leafy greens in indoor controlled environments.

Backed by SoftBank, Jeff Bezos, and others; positioned to disrupt traditional ag supply chains.


## Special Case of Agressive Growth Ventures: *Gazelles*

- A business establishment with at least 20 percent sales growth in each year for 5 years, starting with a base of at least $100,000 in annual sales.
- Gazelles as leaders in innovation:
  - Median growth of 450 percent
  - Top-performing 1 percent of companies account for about 40 percent of jobs.
  - Gazelles make up less than 1 percent of all businesses and account for 10 percent of net new jobs.


::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Mythology Associated with Gazelles"}
- Gazelles are the goal of all entrepreneurs.
- Gazelles receive venture capital.
- Gazelles were never mice.
- Gazelles are high tech.
- Gazelles are global.
:::

## Special Case of Agressive Growth Ventures: *Unicorns*

- A pre-IPO (private) tech start-up company with a $1 billion market value.
- In 2023, 1,191 start-ups were unicorns.

:::{.callout-note icon=false title="Decacorns and Hectacorns"}
- A ‚Äúdecacorn‚Äù
  - Start-ups with a $10 billion or more market value.
  - Examples: Facebook, Uber (taxis), and Airbnb (hotels)
- A ‚Äúhectacorn‚Äù is valued at $100 billion or more.
:::

## Why Economists are Interested in Entrepreneurship

New ventures can change the market structure by shifting supply or introducing entirely new supply curves, as well as generate demand. 

This happens via:

- Market entry and exit
- Pricing and competition
- Consumer access and innovation

<!-- TODO: Add discussion/examples of supply curve shifts in ag/food sectors -->

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Entrepreneurial Firms‚Äô Economic Impact"}

Entrepreneurial firms make two indispensable contributions to an economy:

- They are an integral part of the renewal process that pervades and defines market economies.
- They are fundamental mechanism by which millions enter the economic and social mainstream of society.
:::

## Entrepreneurship: A Mindset

Entrepreneurship is more than the mere creation of business. 

It is a *mindset* where one:

- Seeks opportunities.
- Takes risks beyond security.
- Has the tenacity to push an idea through to reality.

**Entrepreneurship is an integrated concept that permeates an individual‚Äôs business in an innovative manner.**


## The Entrepreneurial Process: Employee vs. Entrepreneur Mindset

- Becoming on entrepreneur is less about the money, the commitment, or the support and **more about the mindset.** 

- It revolves around shifting from an employee mindset to an entrepreneur mindset. 

**The more a person can change their mindset from employee to entrepreneur, the more they will be able to find satisfaction in entrepreneurship.**

:::{.callout-note icon=false title="The Entrepreneurial Mindset Transformation"}
- Entrepreneurship is more than just creating a business; it is an actual spiritual and emotional transformation that takes you from on established way of thinking to a new, groundbreaking mentality. 

- An entrepreneur must get comfortable with being uncomfortable and be able to deal with fear. 

- Entrepreneurship, in whatever capacity or form it shows itself in, is risky and fear inducing. 

- It does not matter if you are selling lemonade in your backyard as a kid, writing your first book, or hustling to market your brand after hours.

## The Evolution of Entrepreneurship

- Entrepreneur is derived from the French *entreprendre*, meaning ‚Äúto undertake.‚Äù
- The entrepreneur is **one who undertakes** to organize, manage, and assume the risks of a business.
- Although no single definition of entrepreneur exists and no one profile can represent today‚Äôs entrepreneurs, research is providing an increasingly sharper focus on the subject.


## A Summary Description of Entrepreneurship

**Entrepreneurship** is...

- The dynamic process of creating incremental wealth through vision, change, and creation
- This wealth is created by individuals who assume major risks in terms of equity, time, and/or career commitment of providing value for a product or service.
- The product or service itself may or may not be new or unique, but the entrepreneur must somehow infuse value by securing and allocating the necessary skills and resources.

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Ingredients of Entrepreneurship"}

What does it take to be an entrepreneur?

- Willingness to take calculated risks‚Äîin terms of time, equity, or career
- Ability to formulate an effective venture team
- Creative skill to marshal needed resources
- Fundamental skills of building a solid business plan
- Vision to recognize opportunity where others see chaos, contradiction, and confusion

## Do Most Entrepreneurial Initiatives Fail? 

Data from the [*Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship*](https://indicators.kauffman.org/) shows that in the state of Colorado, the startup early survival rate is **81.95%**, compared to the national average of **81.70%**.

## Approaches to Entrepreneurship

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
  <img src="../images/01frameworks.png" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 750px;" />
</div>

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="A Framework-of-Frameworks Approach"}
This image from the textbook lays out a ‚ÄúFramework-of-Frameworks‚Äù ‚Äî basically, it maps out how different schools of thought and process models fit into the larger study of entrepreneurship. You‚Äôll see that it brings together both macro and micro perspectives:

On the **macro side**, it includes external influences like culture, capital access, and economic conditions (i.e., things outside the entrepreneur‚Äôs control).

On the **micro side**, it focuses on internal traits and strategic thinking‚Äîthings like personal motivation, opportunity recognition, and business planning.

It also includes **process-based** approaches that look at how ventures are formed and evolve over time, emphasizing inputs (like team or resources) and outcomes (like growth or innovation).

<small>*Rather than detailing each school here, I encourage you to read the corresponding sections in the textbook. It‚Äôs helpful to reference when you start noticing how entrepreneurs are influenced by both their personal traits and their environment ‚Äî and when we explore business cases later in the semester.*</small>
