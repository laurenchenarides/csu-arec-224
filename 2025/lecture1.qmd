## Why Economists are Interested in Entrepreneurship

New ventures can change the market structure by shifting supply or introducing entirely new supply curves. This affects:

- Market entry and exit
- Pricing and competition
- Consumer access and innovation

<!-- TODO: Add discussion/examples of supply curve shifts in ag/food sectors -->

## Entrepreneurship: A Mindset

- Entrepreneurship is more than the mere creation of business. 

It is a *mindset* where one:

- Seeks opportunities.
- Takes risks beyond security.
- Has the tenacity to push an idea through to reality.

**Entrepreneurship is an integrated concept that permeates an individual‚Äôs business in an innovative manner.**


## The Entrepreneurial Process: Employee vs. Entrepreneur Mindset

- Becoming on entrepreneur is less about the money, the commitment, or the support and **more about the mindset.** 

- It revolves around shifting from an employee mindset to an entrepreneur mindset. 

**The more a person can change their mindset from employee to entrepreneur, the more they will be able to find satisfaction in entrepreneurship.**

:::{.callout-note icon=false title="The Entrepreneurial Mindset Transformation"}
- Entrepreneurship is more than just creating a business; it is an actual spiritual and emotional transformation that takes you from on established way of thinking to a new, groundbreaking mentality. 

- An entrepreneur must get comfortable with being uncomfortable and be able to deal with fear. 

- Entrepreneurship, in whatever capacity or form it shows itself in, is risky and fear inducing. 

- It does not matter if you are selling lemonade in your backyard as a kid, writing your first book, or hustling to market your brand after hours.

## The Evolution of Entrepreneurship

- Entrepreneur is derived from the French *entreprendre*, meaning ‚Äúto undertake.‚Äù
- The entrepreneur is **one who undertakes** to organize, manage, and assume the risks of a business.

- This wealth is created by individuals who assume major risks in terms of equity, time, and/or career commitment of providing value for a product or service.
- The product or service itself may or may not be new or unique, but the entrepreneur must somehow infuse value by securing and allocating the necessary skills and resources.


## An Integrated Definition of Entrepreneurship

- Essential ingredients include:
  - Willingness to take calculated risks‚Äîin terms of time, equity, or career
