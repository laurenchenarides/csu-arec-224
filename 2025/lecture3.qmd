# Part 1 <br> Corporate Entrepreneurship

## Icebreaker

Can corporations have an *entrepreneurial mindset*?  

- Share an example you’ve seen in food/ag (e.g., new product launches, sustainability projects).  

- How might a group of friends or a family show the same mindset?


## The Entrepreneurial Mindset in Organizations

Corporations face rapid and unpredictable change. 

To compete, they:  

- Restructure operations.  
- Introduce **corporate entrepreneurship** (aka intrapreneurship).  
- Continuously innovate to keep pace globally.  

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: PepsiCo’s investments in plant-based proteins and sustainable packaging.



## Corporate Innovation Philosophy

Practices that build an innovation-driven company:

- Set **clear innovation goals**.  
- Create feedback and positive reinforcement.  
- Reward innovative ideas, don’t punish failure.  
- Encourage individual responsibility.  

## Quick Poll

Which practice would motivate you most if you worked at a food company?

A. Set **clear innovation goals**.  
B. Create feedback and positive reinforcement.  
C. Reward innovative ideas, don’t punish failure.  
D. Encourage individual responsibility.  


## Assessing Support for Innovation

**Key questions:**  

- Does the company encourage entrepreneurial thinking?  
- Can innovators stick with their ideas?  
- Are there quick ways to access resources?  
- Are small experimental innovations supported?  
- Is risk-taking encouraged and mistakes tolerated?  


📌 *Food/Ag Example*: Chobani’s incubator program for new food startups.




## Rules for an Innovative Environment

- Encourage action & informal meetings.  
- Tolerate and learn from failure.  
- Reward innovation for its own sake.  
- Allow “bootlegging” (working on new ideas secretly).  
- Put people on small teams for future projects.  

💡 *Activity*: In pairs, pick one “rule” you think is easiest vs hardest to implement. Why?




## Corporate Entrepreneurship Terms

- **Corporate Entrepreneurship**: New venture creation or strategic renewal inside an existing firm.  
- **Corporate Innovation**: Developing entrepreneurial spirit, generating new ideas and behaviors.  
- **Corporate Venturing**: New businesses created inside a corporation.  

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: Tyson’s “Tyson Ventures” fund invests in lab-grown meat startups.




## The Need for Corporate Entrepreneurship

Why companies pursue it:  
- New competitors emerging.  
- Traditional management methods distrusted.  
- Talent leaving to start their own businesses.  
- International competition & downsizing.  
- Desire for higher efficiency/productivity.

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: Nestlé’s focus on healthier, plant-based products to respond to consumer demand.




## Obstacles & Solutions

**Traditional practice vs. problem vs. solution**  

- Enforcing rigid procedures → blocks innovation → make ground rules flexible.  
- Controlling against the plan → ignores new learning → update plans as conditions change.  
- Protecting base business at all costs → missed opportunities → take small affordable risks.  

💡 *Game Idea*: Give students short scenarios (e.g., “A dairy cooperative refuses to invest in oat milk”). Ask: Is this traditional thinking or entrepreneurial?




## Successful Innovative Companies

Factors:  

- Clear vision and supportive atmosphere.  
- Market orientation.  
- Flat organizational structure.  
- Multiple approaches to innovation.  
- “Skunk Works” → small, autonomous project teams.  

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: General Mills’ “301 Inc.” venture arm supports startups like Beyond Meat.




## Group Activity 3-1 {data-background-color="lightblue"}

👉 Split into groups. Each group takes one factor (vision, market orientation, flat structure, multiple approaches, learning, skunk works).  

- Find a food/ag company example.  
- Present how that company applies the factor.




# Part 2 <br> Corporate Entrepreneurship

## Icebreaker

Think of a social cause you care about (local or global). How could a business help solve it?




## Defining Social Entrepreneurship

- Mixes nonprofit, government, and business features.  
- Combines innovation, risk-taking, and large-scale transformation with solving social problems.  

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: **Ben & Jerry’s** balancing profit with activism on climate and social justice.



## Social Entrepreneurship Process

1. Recognize a social opportunity.  
2. Translate into an enterprise concept.  
3. Acquire resources.  
4. Execute to achieve social impact.  

📌 Examples: 

- **Water for People** (clean water access).  
- **Sanergy** (sanitation in Kenya).  
- **The Clothing Bank** (training women in South Africa).



## Social Enterprises

- Mission-driven: increase **social value**.  
- Can be nonprofit or for-profit.  
- For-profit model: *Buy One, Give One* (e.g., TOMS Shoes).  

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: **Misfits Market** – sells “ugly” produce at discount, reducing food waste.



## Measuring Social Impact

Ways to measure:  
- Civic wealth/community well-being.  
- Scale breadth (reach more people).  
- Scale depth (deepen services to existing users).  
- Extent of social change.  

💡 *Group Activity*: Pick a food social venture (e.g., World Central Kitchen). Which measure best fits? Why?



## Shared Value & Triple Bottom Line (TBL)

- **Shared Value**: create economic + social value simultaneously.  
- **TBL**: balance *Profit, People, Planet*.  

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: Unilever’s sustainability initiatives in agriculture and packaging.

💡 *Discussion*: If TBL guides decisions, how does it change which projects get funded?



## Benefit Corporations (B Corps)

- **Purpose**: positive social/environmental impact.  
- **Accountability**: consider stakeholders (workers, community, environment).  
- **Transparency**: annual reporting.  
- Certified B Corp: verified by **B Lab**.  

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: **Patagonia Provisions**, **New Belgium Brewing**, **King Arthur Baking**.



## Global Entrepreneurship

- Poverty alleviation through entrepreneurship.  
- Global trade agreements (WTO, USMCA, EU).  
- Ways to go international: exporting, alliances, joint ventures, direct investment, licensing.  

📌 *Food/Ag Example*: Starbucks expanding globally with local partnerships.



## Closing Discussion

- Corporate entrepreneurship = innovating inside established firms.  
- Social entrepreneurship = solving social/environmental challenges through business.  
- Both require entrepreneurial mindset, but with different goals.  

💡 *Game Idea*: “Which bucket?” → Show examples (Beyond Meat, TOMS, PepsiCo, World Central Kitchen). Students decide: corporate entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, or both?
