# Part 1 <br> The Mindset of an Entrepreneur

## The Entrepreneurial Mindset

- Among millennials, 67 percent say their goal involves starting their own business.

- Among Generation Z, 53 percent hope to run their own businesses within 10 years.

> This chapter takes a more psychological look at entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurial cognition.


## Entrepreneurial Cognition

To understand how entrepreneurship emerges, let's examine the science of **cognition**.

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="*Definition:* Cognition"}
Mental functions, mental processes (thoughts), and mental states of intelligent humans—attention, remembering, producing and understanding language, solving problems, and making decisions.
:::

Social Cognition Theory
- Posits that knowledge structures (mental models of cognitions) can be ordered to optimize personal effectiveness within given situations.

Entrepreneurial Cognition
- Knowledge structures that people use to make assessments, judgments, or decisions involving opportunity evaluation, venture creation, and growth.


## A foundation of entrepreneurial thinking is their abiity to adapt

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="*Definition:* Adaptibility"}
The ability to be dynamic, flexible, and self-regulating in one’s cognitions given dynamic and uncertain task environments.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="*Definition:* Metacognitive Model"}
Study of the higher-order cognitive process that resulted in the entrepreneur framing a task effectually, and thus why and how a particular strategy was included in a set of alternative responses to the decision task (metacognition).
:::

## Do entrepreneurs “think” differently?

Perhaps.

Research is still needed to determine whether differences are attributable to a cognitive difference or originates from idiosyncratic factors or from the experience of being entrepreneurs.

> Metacognition is the model used to describe the process an entrepreneur will use to frame the entrepreneurial task.


## Who Are Entrepreneurs?

As you move through the semester, use this table to reflect on how you’re engaging, not just what you’re doing—these are the habits that will carry forward into your future career.


## Can Entrepreneurship Be Cultivated?

According to the theory of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs cause entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurship is a function of the entrepreneur:

$E = f(e)$

Entrepreneurship ($E$) is characterized as the interaction ($f$) of skills ($e$) related to... 

...inner control, planning and goal setting, risk taking, innovation, reality perception, use of feedback, decision making, human relations, and independence... 

...all of which *can* be cultivated. 

::: {.fragment}
Answer: Yes!  
:::

## Discussion Activity 2-1

Look over the list of 16 characteristics and label those that you believe are most important from the first to the fifth. 

Think of an example for each.

Discuss as a class which characteristics showed up on most lists. 

Which showed up on only a few?


::: {.notes}
Start this discussion by having each person work individually to label five of the characteristics from the most important (1) to the fifth most important (5). Then work as a class to compare the five labeled by each person. Could consider listing those from one person and then add counts as other read their lists. The class can discuss why some were listed by nearly all students, and some listed by only a few, or no students.
:::


## Entrepreneurs have a tolerance for failure.

This involves a capacity--often learned--to deal with failure and process grief.


::: {.callout-note icon=false title="*Definition:* Loss Orientation"}
Involves focusing on the particular loss to construct an account that explains why the loss occurred.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="*Definition:* Restoration Orientation"}
Involves both distracting oneself from thinking about the failure event and being proactive toward secondary causes of stress.
:::

## The Entrepreneurial Experience

An individual *sees* the opportunity $\rightarrow$ *creates* the venture $\rightarrow$ and the entrepreneur *emerges*.


::: {.notes}
Entrepreneurs create ventures much as an artist creates a painting. They are formed by the lived experience of venture creation.
:::

# Part 2 <br> The Dark Side of Entrepreneurship 

## The Entrepreneur’s Confrontation with Risk

- Financial risk versus profit (return) motive varies in entrepreneurs’ desire for wealth.
- Career risk—loss of employment security.
- Family and social risk—competing commitments of work and family.
- Psychic risk—psychological impact of failure on the well-being of entrepreneurs.

## Stress and the Entrepreneur

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="*Definition:* Entrepreneurial Stress"}
The extent to which entrepreneurs’ work demands and expectations exceed their abilities to perform as venture initiators, they are likely to experience stress.
:::

Sources of Entrepreneurial Stress
- Loneliness
- Immersion in business
- People problems
- Need to achieve

##  Discussion Activity 2-2 

Read each statement and mark the column that most appropriately represents your level of agreement.

| Statement             | Strongly Disagree (1) | Disagree (2) | Neither Disagree Nor Agree (3) | Agree (4) | Strongly Agree (5) |
|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| I often feel a severe sense of time urgency. |  |  |  |  |
| I find myself constantly involved in multiple projects subject to deadlines. |  |  |  |  |
| I often neglect of all aspects of life except work. |  |  |  |  |
| I have a tendency to take on excessive responsibility, combined with the feeling that “Only I am capable of taking care of this matter.” |  |  |  |  |
| I have a tendency to speak faster than most people.|  |  |  |  |

Then, calculate your total score.

## Discussion Activity 2-2 

Type A Assessment

- Getting away from it all
- Communicating with employees
- Finding satisfaction outside the company
- Delegating
- Exercising rigorously
- Therapy with a professional

# Part 3 <br> Entrepreneurial Ethics

## Sources of Ethical Dilemmas

Facing pressure from inside and outside interests can influence decision-making, especially when undertaking new business ventures.

Aside from changes in societal values and norms, business owners must consider legal issues.

$\rightarrow$ Having a clear set of parameters or rules that govern ambiguous decision-making can be important. 

## Ethics & Ethical Dilemmas

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Ethics provide the basic rules or parameters for conducting any activity in an “acceptable” manner.
- Represent a set of principles prescribing a behavioral code of what is good and right or bad and wrong.
- They define “situational” moral duty and obligations.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Ethics represent a set of principles prescribing a behavioral code that explains what is good and right, or bad and wrong.
- Instead of relying on a set of fixed ethical principles, entrepreneurs should develop an ethical process for making decisions.
:::

:::



## Ethical Rationalizations

Ethical rationalizations used to justify questionable conduct involve believing that the activity:
Is not “really” illegal or immoral.
Is in the individual’s or the firm’s best interest.
Will never be found out.
Helps the company, so the company will condone it.


## Types of Morally Questionable Acts

## Overlap between Moral Standards and Legal Requirements

There are vast differences that sometimes exist between morality (ethics) and law.


![](../images/02figure2.3diagram.png){.uniform-image}

## The Matter of Morality & The Complexity of Ethical Descisions

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Greed
Distinctions between activities at work and activities at home.
Lack of a foundation in ethics
Survival (bottom-line thinking)
Reliance on other social institutions.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Complexity of Ethical Decisions
Extended consequences
Multiple alternatives
Mixed outcomes
Uncertain ethical consequences
Personal implications

:::

:::

## Group Activity 2-1

[Placeholder] Ethical dilemma in ag, perhaps food safety

Working in groups of two or three, search the Internet to find either (1) an example of an ethical statement by a company or (2) a case study of an ethical dilemma in business.
Try to find the most real-world examples.
Present what was found to the class and what can be learned from that example or case.


## Establishing a Strategy for an Ethical Venture

Ethical Codes of Conduct:
Are statements of ethical practices or guidelines to which an enterprise adheres.
Are becoming more prevalent in the industry.
Are proving to be more meaningful in terms of external legal and social development.
Are more comprehensive in terms of their coverage.
Are easier to implement in terms of the administrative procedures used to enforce them.


::: {.notes}
Create small groups of 2 or 3 students each. Then each group can decide if they want to find an example of an ethical statement by a company or a case study of an ethical dilemma in business. While the statements might be easier to find, the case studies can be more interesting and fun. Have each group present, focusing on what can be learned from that example or case study.
:::

## “Always Do the Right Thing”

Reasons for management to adhere to a high moral code:
It is good business because unethical practices have a corrosive effect, not only on the firm itself, but on free markets and free trade that are fundamental to the survival of the free enterprise system.
Improving the moral climate of the firm will eventually win back the public’s confidence in the firm.

## Ethical Considerations of Corporate Entrepreneurs

Organizational barriers that invite unethical behaviors:
Systems, structures, policies and procedures, culture, strategic direction, people
Promote ethical employee behaviors by:
Providing flexibility, innovation, and support of initiative and risk taking.
Removing barriers for entrepreneurial middle managers.
Including an ethical component to corporate training.

## Ethical Leadership by Entrepreneurs

The value system of an owner/entrepreneur is the key to establishing an ethical organization.
A code of ethics provides a clear understanding of the need for:
Ethical administrative decision making.
Ethical behavior of employees.
Explicit rewards and punishments based on ethical behavior.

## Entrepreneurial Motivation

Entrepreneurial Motivation
The quest for new-venture creation as well as the willingness to sustain that venture.
Personal characteristics, personal environment, business environment, personal goal set (expectations), and the existence of a viable business idea
Entrepreneurial Persistence
An entrepreneur’s choice to continue with an entrepreneurial opportunity regardless of counterinfluences or other enticing alternatives.
