**This week, we’ll look at three pathways to pursue entrepreneurial ventures:**  
1. ______________________  
2. ______________________  
3. ______________________  



## Three Pathways
**Entrepreneurs generally enter ventures through three pathways:**  

- **______________________________:** Build from scratch, new idea, higher risk but higher control.  
  *Example: launching a farm-based kombucha brand.*  

- **______________________________:** Buy an established business with history, contracts, staff.  
  *Example: purchasing a dairy operation from retiring owners.*  

- **______________________________:** Buy into a proven business system with support and brand recognition.  
  *Example: running a Subway franchise near a university.*  

**Analogy:**  
- ______________ = clearing a new field.  
- ______________ = buying a farm.  
- ______________ = joining a cooperative with shared tools and systems.  

# Pathway #1 New Venture Creation

## The Story of Sweetgreen
**Origins:** Sweetgreen began as a single salad shop near Georgetown University in 2007.  

**______________ ______________:**  
- Build healthier communities with convenient, fast-casual, sustainable food.  
- Solve the tradeoff between fast/cheap/unhealthy food and slow/expensive/fresh food.  



## The Story of Sweetgreen (cont.)
**Customer ______________:**  
- Health-conscious consumers in urban areas and college students.  
- Individuals seeking convenient meal options, willing to pay for quality.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Seasonal, plant-forward menu.  
- Transparent supply chain with farmers.  
- Mobile app for ordering/delivery.  
- Automation/new kitchen technology (e.g., “Infinite Kitchen”).  



## The Story of Sweetgreen (cont.)
**Revenue Streams:**  
- Sales from in-store and online orders.  
- Delivery service revenue through owned app.  
- Corporate catering.  

**Recent Challenges (Q2 2025):**  
- Decline in same-store sales and traffic.  
- Wider net loss year-over-year.  
- Volatile stock price, 52-week low.  



## Creating New Ventures
Entrepreneurs think about how their idea is positioned relative to existing offerings.  

Two approaches (textbook):  
- **______________ Approach**  
- **______________ Approach**  



## ______________ Approach
- Identify something that does not yet exist and create it from scratch.  
- Requires observing unmet needs, frustrations, or inefficiencies.  
- Example in agribusiness: apps integrating satellite imagery with irrigation scheduling.  
- High risk (customers unfamiliar) but high potential reward.  



## ______________ Approach
- Adapt, improve, or extend an existing concept.  
- Example: customizable CSA subscription boxes.  
- Easier for customers to understand/adopt, but allows differentiation through quality, service, or market reach.  



## Trends in Agri-Business Startups
- Sample of 5,290 global startups analyzed.  
- Technology advances (automation, drones, biotech) drive most innovation.

## A Newness Framework for New Ventures
Framework helps us think about how “new” a venture is.  

**Dimensions:**  
- _______________________ (incremental vs. radical).  
- _______________________ (incremental vs. radical).  



## Entrepreneurial Newness Framework
*Source: Kuratko, Fisher, Bloodgood, Hornsby (2017), Small Business Economics 49(1):124.*  

Framework gauges:  
- How bold or incremental a venture is.  
- Risks and opportunities of that positioning.  



## Examining the Financial Picture
After feasibility analysis (Week 5) and business plan (not yet covered):  

- **For _______________:** risk vs. reward analysis.  
- **For acquisitions:** picture looks different…  

**Checklist for _______________ Expenses:**  
- Inventory  
- Equipment  
- Payroll  
- Utilities  
- Debt service  
- Legal/professional fees  
- Licenses  
- More…  



# Pathway #2 Acquisition

## Acquiring an Established Venture

**Sources:** brokers, trade associations, newspapers, contacts, online.  

**Advantages:**  
- Customers, contracts, brand reputation.  
- Staff, inventory, facilities in place.  
- Reduced failure risk, quicker path to revenue.  

*Example:* Young entrepreneur buys a fruit orchard.  
- Benefits: loyal customers, contracts with grocers.  
- Challenges: aging trees, outdated equipment.  


## Evaluating an Established Venture
Evaluation requires background info:  
- Profits, sales, ratios.  
- Inventory/equipment.  
- Intellectual property.  
- Goodwill/reputation.  

**Prompt:** Which would you prioritize in an agribusiness purchase? Why?  



## The Buying Process: What to Look For (1/2)
Less about “hardball negotiation,” more about careful evaluation.  

**Influences:**  
- **Information:** More info = better decisions.  
- **Time:** Don’t rush, uncover problems.  
- **Pressure:** Seller pressure (retirement, debt) shapes deal.  
- **Alternatives:** More options = stronger position.  



## The Buying Process: What to Look For (2/2)
**Considerations for Buyers:**  
- Seller may stay as minority owner for continuity.  
- Price can depend on future performance (3–5 years).  
- Trust only written promises.  
- Review books carefully.  
- Talk to vendors, customers, employees, competitors.  



# Pathway #3 Franchising

## Franchising: The Hybrid

**Discussion:**  
- Have you considered owning a franchise? Why/why not?  
- What agribusiness-related franchises can you think of?  

**Show of hands:**  
- Who has eaten at McDonald’s, Subway, Dairy Queen?  
- Who has been to Tractor Supply, John Deere dealers, farm supply stores?  



## Franchising: Definition & Terms
**___________________:** Arrangement where franchisor licenses franchisee to use trademarks, trade names, systems.  

**Roles:**  
- ___________________ = buyer.  
- ___________________ = seller.  



## How Franchising Works
**Franchisee Obligations:**  
- Invest capital.  
- Maintain standardized inventory/equipment.  
- Pay fees/royalties.  
- Maintain quality.  

**Franchisor Provides:**  
- Brand identity.  
- Training/support.  
- Merchandise, equipment, food.  
- Financing, guidance.  



## Pros and Cons of Franchising
**Advantages:**  
- Training/support.  
- Brand recognition.  
- Proven system lowers risk.  
- Financing options.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- High upfront/ongoing fees.  
- Strict control.  
- Some franchisors under-deliver.  
- A franchise can feel like a “golden cage.”  



## Franchise Law & FDD
**Franchise Rule (FTC):**  
- Requires franchisors to provide FDD 14 days before signing/paying.  

**FDD:**  
- 23 required categories.  
- Must be delivered pre-contract.  
- Protects franchisees from incomplete info.  



## Support Systems: Incubators, Accelerators, Ecosystems
**What helps you succeed once you choose a pathway?**  

- **Incubators:** “Daycare” – safe, long-term support (space, training, mentorship).  
  *Example: food innovation hubs with shared kitchens.*  

- **Accelerators:** “Boot camp” – short, intensive, often equity-based.  
  *Example: Colorado AgTech accelerators funding drone startups.*  

- **Ecosystems:** Networks of entrepreneurs, mentors, regulators, investors.  
  *Example: Fort Collins food innovation network (CSU, farmers, startups).*  



## Recall (Week 5): How Incubators & Accelerators Help
Programs lower cost, time, risk of starting ventures.  

- Provide shared space/resources, access to mentors.  
- Guide funding estimates, connect with grants, investors, competitions.  
- Offer market intelligence, legal/regulatory support, peer learning.  
- Validate ideas technically/legally through review/testing.  
- Support customer discovery, refine value proposition.  
- Advise on pricing, distribution, reaching first customers.
