## Welcome, Mentors

Thank you for serving as a mentor in AREC 224: *Introduction to Agribusiness Entrepreneurship*! This course would not be what it is without your time, experience, and presence. You’ll help students gain real-world insight into entrepreneurship by sharing your story, offering feedback, and encouraging their growth.

This guide outlines your role, the timeline, and how to prepare.

## Your Role

You’ll be paired with a small group of students (a "pod") who will:

- Interview you in a **student-produced podcast** (recorded on campus)
- Prepare a business case concept based on your story
- Present the business case concept at the **end-of-semester competition** (think of this as a "story-telling" event)

As a mentor, you will:

- **Be interviewed** (Week 4–6) for a 30–40 min podcast episode. We’ll provide sample questions and a recording studio.
- **Meet with your pod twice** during the semester to provide feedback and guidance.
- **Attend the final case competition and networking event** during Week 15 (2-hour event).


## Timeline of Activities

The course runs from **August 25 to December 14, 2025**, and follows a weekly schedule. Weeks are numbered based on the academic calendar. You can refer to the [Course Schedule](schedule.qmd) for specific dates associated with each week.

The table below outlines major milestones involving mentor-student engagement, along with expectations for both mentors and students.

| Week | Activity | Mentor Action | Student Role |

| 4–6  | Podcast Interview | Attend a 30–40 min recorded podcast session at CSU studio | Host and produce podcast episode featuring mentor’s story |
| 8    | Mid-Semester Feedback | Submit short feedback form for each student in your pod | Receive and reflect on mentor feedback for E-IDP refinement |
| 12–13 | Second Pod Meeting | Join second 30–45 min check-in; provide guidance on business case direction | Present progress on business concept and solicit mentor input |
| 15   | Final Competition | Attend and watch student pitches; submit final feedback form | Present final business case inspired by mentor story |


We’ll coordinate scheduling via email and provide reminders.



## Preparing for Your Interview

The podcast interview will be student-led and conversational. You don’t need to prepare a script, but here are suggested prompts they may explore:

- What problem did you set out to solve?
- What was your “aha” moment—or was it gradual?
- What challenges did you face early on?
- What business model did you choose and why?
- How did you define success?
- What advice would you give your younger self?
- How do you see your business evolving?

You’re welcome to share lessons, numbers, pivots, and surprises—anything that brings your story to life.



## Supporting Your Pod

You’ll meet your student group twice—once mid-semester and once as they prepare for final pitches. These are informal 30–45 minute virtual or in-person sessions.

Students may ask for your perspective on:

- Customer needs
- Market trends
- Growth strategies
- Communication and branding
- Your feedback on their evolving business idea

You don’t need to “grade” anything—your role is to guide, challenge, and encourage.

### About the E-IDP

Each student is building an [**Entrepreneurial Individual Development Plan (E-IDP)**](eidp.qmd) throughout the semester. This plan helps them reflect on and strengthen key entrepreneurial skills—ranging from creativity and persistence to opportunity recognition and team leadership.

At **Week 8**, we’ll ask you to submit a short feedback form (3 questions) based on your interactions so far. This is not an evaluation—it’s a chance to offer encouragement and suggestions for growth. We’ll ask for a second round of feedback after the final case presentations in **Week 15**.

Your perspective helps make this learning experience more real and more personal for each student.

## Final Pitch Competition

At the end of the semester, students will present their business concepts (inspired by your story) in a class-wide competition. You’ll be invited to attend as a guest and cheer them on.
