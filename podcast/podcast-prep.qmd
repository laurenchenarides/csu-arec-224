## Header

## Pod Members & Roles
- **[Name] — Pre-Production:** research, scheduling, question prep

> **Note on Roles and Responsibilities:**
> The listed [podcast roles](https://laurenchenarides.github.io/csu-arec-224/podcast/podcast-instructions.html#roles-within-your-pod) are intended as general guides. Some pods may not have four members, and that’s okay. In every group, at least one student must serve as a co-host during the recording. The remaining responsibilities (research, fact checking, show notes, scheduling, etc.) should be divided fairly among the pod members so that everyone contributes meaningfully. Grades will be assigned individually to account for variation in contributions, if that becomes an issue.
