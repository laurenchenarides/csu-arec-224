## Why This Matters

By the end of this mentorship program, you may want to ask your mentor to write you a recommendation letter for a scholarship, internship, or job.

$\rightarrow$ What do you want them to say about you?\
$\rightarrow$ How can your **E-IDP practice plans** give them the concrete examples they would need to write you an effective letter of recommendation?

Today’s activity helps you connect your **E-IDP characteristics** and **practice plans** into a draft “brag sheet” you could use when asking for a recommendation letter.

## Step 1: Warm-Up (5 minutes)

Revisit the **three entrepreneurial characteristics** you chose earlier this semester.\
For each, write down the practice plan you wrote.

| Characteristic | My Practice Plan (from earlier exercise)                                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\.            |                                                                                    |
| 2\.            |                                                                                    |
| 3\.            |                                                                                    |

## Step 2: Translate Into Strengths (5 minutes)

Rewrite each characteristic as if someone else were recommending you.\
*(Use third person: “She demonstrates…” / “He consistently…”)*

| Characteristic | Strength Statement (Recommendation Style)                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\.            |                                                                                     |
| 2\.            |                                                                                     |
| 3\.            |                                                                                     |

## Step 3: Build a Letter Outline (10 minutes)

Most recommendation letters follow this structure:\
1. **Introduction** – Who you are and purpose of the letter.\
2. **Context** – Relationship or role that gives credibility.\
3. **Body Paragraphs** – Each highlights a strength (with examples).\
4. **Closing** – Strong recommendation and future potential.

\newpage

**Task:**\
- Write a 1–2 sentence **intro** and **closing**.\
- Use your strength statements + practice plans as your **body paragraphs**.

**Sentence Starters:**\
- *It is my pleasure to recommend [Your Name] for…*\
- *Three strengths that distinctly characterize [Your Name] are…*\
- *One example of [Characteristic] is…*\
- *With that, I enthusiastically recommend [Your Name] for…*

## Step 4: Reflection & Pair Share (10 minutes)

Work with a partner:\
1. Share the strength statements you wrote about yourself.\
2. Give feedback:\
- Which characteristic came across most clearly?\
- Which one could use a stronger example?\
3. Write down one idea from your partner you want to add to your own brag sheet.

## Step 5: Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

Think ahead: if you asked your mentor for a letter at the end of the semester,\
- What would you want them to highlight?\
- How will you show evidence of your characteristics so they can?

*(Write 2–3 bullet points as an action reminder for yourself.)*
