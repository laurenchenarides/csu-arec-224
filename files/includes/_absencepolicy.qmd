### Attendance Policy

Although attendance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended that you attend class. 

### Make-Up Policy

If you anticipate missing a quiz or exam, you must notify the instructor **at least two weeks prior to the absence** and it will be at the discretion of the instructor if a make-up is scheduled.  If a make-up is granted, it will only be granted once throughout the entire semester. There are no make-ups for homework.  

### Sick Policy

If you test positive for COVID, please do not come to class. If you test positive on the day of an exam or your illness coincides with an exam and you were not able to give two weeks’ notice of your absence, please email a doctor’s note to the instructor.

### Cell Phones & Other Electronic Devices

Cell phones, etc. must be turned to silent or vibrate mode during class. No texting, emailing, surfing the internet, etc. will be allowed during class.
