Each student in this course will engage with our weekly case studies in three ways: 

(1) A **Fishbowl participant**
(2) An **Observer** 
(3) A **weekly submitter** of a short written reflection

Here's what to expect in each role:

## üó£Ô∏è Fishbowl Team

You and your team will lead the in-class case discussion for your assigned week. This is your chance to take the perspective of an entrepreneur, investor, or analyst‚Äîand practice real-time decision-making and communication.

**Your responsibilities:**

- Read the full case carefully and review the associated teaching note (posted in Canvas).
- Meet with your team in advance to prepare your analysis.
- Come ready to present: no slides are required, but visuals are welcome.
- Participate fully in the discussion, bringing data, insight, and clear recommendations.

**Resources:**

- [Case Analysis Worksheet](https://eproduct.hbsp.harvard.edu/eproduct/product/t_case_companion/content/assets/Case-Analysis-Checklist_HBP_EducationForm_en.e891f435.pdf)
- [Michael A. Roberto. (2022). *Case Companion*](coursepack.qmd)

## üëÅÔ∏è Observer Team

Your job is to observe the fishbowl discussion critically and constructively. You will model active listening and provide structured feedback to your peers.

**Your responsibilities:**

- Submit the weekly pre-class reflection like everyone else.
- During class, take notes on the discussion and complete the observer form:
  - 1‚Äì2 sentences of praise: What did the group do well?
  - 1 question you would have added to the conversation.
  - What did you learn from observing?

You‚Äôll submit your feedback via Canvas right after class.

## ‚úèÔ∏è All Students: Weekly Pre-Class Reflection

Every student will complete a short reflection before each Thursday class, due by **11:59pm the night before**.

**What to include:**

- **Summary (100‚Äì150 words):** What is the core challenge in the case?
- **Your Recommendation:** What would you do in the entrepreneur‚Äôs shoes?
- **Discussion Question:** One thoughtful question you‚Äôd ask in class.

You‚Äôll complete this in Canvas. These reflections will help you stay engaged and give the fishbowl team great questions to work with.
