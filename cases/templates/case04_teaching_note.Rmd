How do you expand Chewse without losing its culture?

# Turning Point

## Investor Pushback

- Lawrence reframed: Chewse isn’t “out for blood” — it’s **“out for love.”**  
- Raised **$5.6M Series A** with Foundry Group (B Corp) + others.  

**Tension:** Culture as a liability vs. culture as a strategic advantage.

- Easier to maintain culture.  
- Lower employee churn.  
- Easier to pivot if needed.  
- Builds trust in the brand.
