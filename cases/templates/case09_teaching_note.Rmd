## Today's Agenda

1. Case Discussion: Collins-Carey et al. (2020), *JUST, Inc.: Clean Meat and the Future of Protein Alternatives* — led by **Team E**.  
2. Focus on the strategic choice among four paths:  
   - **Enter clean meat** (cultured meat)  
   - **Enter plant-based meat**  
   - **Enter edible insects**  
   - **Double down on plant-based alternatives** (status quo/core)  
3. Connect to this week’s concepts: **industry life cycles**, **dominant design**, **go-to-market**, and **mission–strategy fit**.


## Key Terms: Alternative Protein Landscape

- **Clean (Cultured) Meat** – Animal cells grown in bioreactors to form edible muscle tissue.  
- **Plant-Based Meat** – Texture/flavor engineered from plant proteins (e.g., soy, pea, wheat).  
- **Plant-Based Alternatives** – Non-meat analogs (e.g., JUST Egg, mayo, dressings).  
- **Edible Insects** – Protein from insects (e.g., crickets) whole or as ingredients (flour).  
- **Dominant Design** – A prevailing product architecture that shapes competition.  
- **First-Mover Advantage** – Benefits from early market entry before standards/leaders emerge.


## Role Play: You Are Josh Tetrick (CEO)

- Mission-driven founder with prior wins (JUST Egg) and a **controversial history** that raises reputational/regulatory risk.  
- **Decision (2017)**: Where should JUST invest next to lead the protein transition?  
- Constraints: capital intensity (esp. clean meat), regulatory uncertainty, consumer acceptance, and competition.

| 2018–2020 | Accel in clean meat R&D across industry (e.g., Memphis Meats, Aleph) | Competitive race; rising capital needs |


## Learning Objectives (for Students)

- Evaluate **market attractiveness** across clean meat, plant-based meat, insects, and core plant-based alternatives.  
- Assess **fit** with JUST’s resources/capabilities and **mission alignment**.  
- Anticipate **go-to-market** hurdles: regulation, cost curves, consumer adoption, supply chains.


## Market Snapshots

### Clean Meat
- **Pros:** Potential parity on taste/texture; large long-run TAM; ethical/land/water upside.  
- **Cons:** High capex + R&D risk; regulation & labeling; consumer “lab-grown” skepticism; energy intensity.

### Plant-Based Meat
- **Pros:** Momentum + near-term growth; access to flexitarians; leverages JUST’s discovery platform.  
- **Cons:** Strong incumbents (Beyond, Impossible); taste/texture arms race; late-mover risks.

### Plant-Based Alternatives (Core)
- **Pros:** Brand equity; proven ops scaling (JUST Egg); lower regulatory friction.  
- **Cons:** Finite substitution space; supply chain build-outs for novel inputs; slower path to category leadership.

### Edible Insects
- **Pros:** Efficient feed conversion; niche demand growth; ingredient versatility.  
- **Cons:** Cultural barriers in U.S.; fragmented field; far from JUST’s capabilities/brand.


## Industry Life Cycle & Design

- **Where are categories on the curve?**  
  - Clean meat: **emergent / pre-dominant design**  
  - Plant-based meat: **growth / design converging**  
  - Plant-based alternatives: **growth / fragmentation by application**  
  - Insects: **emergent / niche**

## The Strategic Choice

**Options:**

1. **Enter Clean Meat** (pursue first-mover potential)  
2. **Enter Plant-Based Meat** (fast-follower vs. incumbents)  
3. **Enter Edible Insects** (ingredient play, niche)  
4. **Double Down on Core** (expand plant-based alternatives portfolio)


## Connect These Options with Legal & Marketing Hurdles

- **Regulatory pathways** → cultured vs. plant-based products
- **Food safety & liability** → GMP, traceability, recalls
- **Contracts & market access** → brokers, co-manufacturing, slotting
- **Cottage vs. Commercial** → why JUST can’t be “cottage”
- **Pricing & costs** → thin margins, scaling choices
- **Brand & positioning** → dominant design and focus

::: {.callout-tip}
Goal: Use Lecture 9 tools to evaluate **which path** (clean meat, plant-based meat, core plant-based, insects) best fits JUST’s mission, means, and market.
:::


## Regulatory Pathways (FDA/USDA)
**Cultured meat (clean meat)**

- Pre-market consultations, facility registration, inspections
- Joint FDA–USDA oversight (cells → FDA; harvest/processing → USDA)
- Labeling and nomenclature uncertainty

**Plant-based**

- FDA food rules (ingredients, allergens, GRAS, labeling)
- Claims (protein quality, sustainability) need substantiation

**Implication for JUST**

- **Clean meat**: longer, costlier path; high policy risk
- **Plant-based**: clearer path; faster channel expansion

**Prompt:** If the **dominant design** in cultured meat is 3–5 years out, does JUST want to **shape** it or **follow** it?


## Food Safety, GMP, and Liability
- **GMP** is non-negotiable for national retail
- **Traceability**: one-step forward/back, batch IDs, recall readiness
- **Risk**: contamination, allergen control, supply chain failures

**JUST Application**

- Clean meat: aseptic bioprocessing, media control, QA/QC uptick
- Plant-based: co-manufacturing + supplier audits; simpler—but still strict

**Quick Check:** What **documentation** must JUST have in place before pitching a national QSR pilot?


## Contracts & Channel Access
- **Brokers/Distributors**: unlock retail buyers but take margin
- **Slotting/Promotion**: trade spend planning matters
- **Co-packing**: capacity, MOQs, lead times, quality specs, IP/NDAs
- **Force majeure**: supply shocks, logistics, recalls

**JUST Application**

- Core/plant-based: leverage co-packers to scale JUST Egg–adjacent lines
- Clean meat: likely JV/strategics for pilot plants + foodservice entry

**Exercise:** Draft 3 must-have **contract clauses** JUST should demand from a co-packer for a new plant-based SKU.


## Cottage Food vs. Commercial Reality
- Cottage laws vs. wholesale/interstate
- National brands require **commercial facilities** + audits (GMP/HACCP)

**JUST Application**

- All four paths require commercial compliance; **no cottage shortcuts**
- Clean meat adds **bioprocess** validation and new SOPs


## Market Access & Competition
**Barriers**

- Shelf space (category captaincy by incumbents)
- Velocity expectations, cold chain, slotting fees
- Consumer acceptance (taste, texture, name)

**Playbooks**

- **Plant-based**: fast-follower differentiation (protein source, nutrition, price)
- **Clean meat**: staged foodservice launches; transparent messaging
- **Core**: deepen penetration (foodservice + retail), capacity expansion

**Think:** What is JUST’s “**Haribo focus**”? (One killer SKU or platform where it can dominate.)


## Costs, Pricing, and Thin Margins
- Rising inputs, labor, freight, trade spend → squeeze gross margin
- Clean meat: **Very high capex/opex** until media yield improves
- Plant-based/core: scale lowers COGS; ingredient hedging helps

**Decision Lens**

- Can JUST hit a **price-to-value** that drives velocity without burning runway?


## Compare the Paths

| Path | Strategic Fit | Capital Need | Regulatory Risk | Consumer Adoption | Speed to Revenue |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Clean Meat | High (mission) / Medium (capabilities) | **Very High** | **High** | Medium (omnivores) | Low |
| Plant-Based Meat | High | High | Medium | Medium–High | Medium |
| Core Alternatives | **Very High** | Medium | Low | High (existing) | **High** |
| Insects | Low | Medium | Medium | Low–Medium (U.S.) | Low |


## Finance & Ops Implications

- **Clean Meat**: Bioreactors, cell lines, scaffolding, media costs, QA; multi-year burn to unit economics.  
- **Plant-Based Meat**: Ingredient supply (pea/soy/wheat proteins), extrusion tech, flavor science.  
- **Core**: Capacity expansions, channel partnerships (retail/foodservice), brand building.  
- **Insects**: Farming or sourcing, processing to ingredients, B2B demand development.
