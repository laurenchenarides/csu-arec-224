<!-- # Framing the Case -->

## Founder’s Perspective

**Role Play**

- Imagine you are **Markus Berger, founder of Dinr**.  
- Your goals:  
  - Prove the *on-demand meal kit* model works in London.  
  - Raise money to extend runway.  
  - Turn first-time buyers into repeat customers.  

**Key Question:**  

How do you make Dinr financially sustainable before the cash runs out?  


<!-- # Case Overview -->

## Dinr at a Glance

- Founded in **2012** by Markus Berger, former Google employee.  
- London-based same-day **meal ingredient delivery** service.  
- Customers ordered online; Dinr delivered pre-measured ingredients + recipe cards.  
- Differentiation:  
  - **On-demand orders** (no subscription).  
  - Targeted **young urban professionals**.  
  - Premium experience: recipe cards, surprise gifts, playlists, wine suggestions.  

**Mission:** Teach people to cook quality meals at home with ease.  

## The Founder, Markus Berger

- Born in **Brno, Czech Republic (1978)**; trained as a lawyer at Vienna University.  
- Early career: **consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton**, then earned an **MBA at London Business School**.  
- Worked at **Google London (2008–2012)** in account management and business development.  
- Inspired by **Jamie Oliver’s TED Talk** on teaching people to cook and by emerging meal-kit startups in Europe.  
- Personal motivation: more passion for **education and improving lives** than for food itself.  
  - Wanted to help people master at least **ten quality home-cooked meals**.  
- Cofounded Dinr in **2012** with Atul Mahajan (part-time tech co-founder).

## Dinr Competitors

- **HelloFresh** – Subscription-based, backed by Rocket Internet, aggressive growth.  
- **Gousto** – UK subscription startup, heavy fundraising.  
- **Middagsfrid (Sweden)** – First mover, sustainability focus.  

::: {.callout-tip title="Discussion Prompt"}
How did Dinr’s *on-demand* positioning differ from subscription-based competitors?  
What advantages and risks did this choice create?  
:::


<!-- # Turning Point -->

## Early Results

- Initial traction: some enthusiasm, but **low repeat orders** (avg. 1.53).  
- CAC (£30.4) > CLV.  
- Customers liked the food, but did not reorder enough.  
- Berger raised **£60,000 via Seedrs crowdfunding** (2013).  

**Challenge:** Build habit and loyalty in a market dominated by subscription players.  


<!-- # Growth Strategy -->

## Relaunch Efforts

- Invested in glossy new website with high-quality food photography.  
- Hired a culinary intern to create 8 new themed recipes per week.  
- Added **membership option** (£5/month for 10% discount).  
- Considered switching to subscription model, but decided against it.  

::: {.callout-tip title="Discussion Prompt"}
Why might Berger have resisted adopting a subscription model?  
Would you advise him differently?  
:::


## Strategic Dilemma

- **Funding pressures**: Limited runway, failed accelerator applications, reliance on crowdfunding.  
- **Execution issues**: Tech delays with overseas developers.  
- **Market pressures**: HelloFresh and Gousto scaling rapidly with large VC rounds.  

**Founder’s Challenge:**  

What should Berger do next to attract repeat customers and secure sustainable funding?   


## Compare Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Stay On-Demand | Differentiates from competitors; flexible for customers | Harder to build loyalty; higher marketing costs |
| Pivot to Subscription | Recurring revenue; aligns with investor expectations | Competes head-on with better-funded rivals |
| Hybrid (on-demand + membership) | Offers flexibility + some loyalty | Complex to manage; unclear positioning |  


## Make a Recommendation: Which Path?

- **On-Demand**  
  - Keeps differentiation, but high risk of running out of money.  

- **Subscription**  
  - Easier to model growth, more attractive to investors.  

- **Hybrid**  
  - Potential compromise, but resource-intensive for small team.  


<!-- # Wrap-Up -->

## Scorecard Totals

- **On-Demand** → ___ / 5  
- **Subscription** → ___ / 5  
- **Hybrid** → ___ / 5  

## Discussion Points

- Which growth model makes most sense given Dinr’s resources?  
- How should Berger balance vision (education + flexibility) with financial realities?  
- How do customer acquisition and retention metrics drive the decision?  


## Exit Strategy

- Berger’s vision: not a billion-dollar business, but a few million in revenue and a solid first startup experience.  
- Actual outcome: Dinr struggled to scale and eventually shut down, without a formal exit.  

**Discussion Prompt:**  

- What realistic exit strategies could Berger have pursued?  
  - Acquisition by a larger meal-kit company?  
  - Building toward a sustainable lifestyle business?  
  - Positioning for strategic partnerships?  
- How do the sources of funding (friends/family, crowdfunding) shape the expectations for an exit?  
- Should founders think about exit strategy from the beginning, or focus first on product–market fit?  


## Key Takeaways

- **Business model matters**: Revenue structure must match market + investor expectations.  
- **Execution risk**: Technical delays and founder bandwidth can derail progress.  
- **Funding challenge**: Crowdfunding offers quick capital, but limited runway.  
- **Entrepreneurial lesson**: Passion and vision must align with repeatable, scalable economics.  

::: {.callout-note title="What Happened?"}
Dinr ultimately struggled to compete with heavily funded subscription rivals.  
Berger later pivoted to other ventures, but the Dinr experience served as his entrepreneurial training ground.
