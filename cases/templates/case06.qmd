## Today's Agenda

1. Case Discussion: Hoffman (2021), *White Oak Pastures: A Radically Traditional Farm Redefines Growth*. Lead by **Team D**.  
2. Explore two key decisions:  
   - Transitioning to regenerative agriculture.  
   - Building an on-site processing facility.  


## Key Terms: Regenerative Agriculture

- **Cover Cropping** – Planting crops that enrich soil health rather than for harvest.  
- **No-Till Farming** – Avoiding mechanical tillage to preserve soil structure.  
- **Adaptive Grazing** – Rotating animals to allow pasture regrowth and carbon capture.  
- **Regenerative Organic Certified (ROC)** – Certification based on soil health, animal welfare, and social fairness.  


## Key Terms: Processing & Vertical Integration

- **Abattoir** – Slaughterhouse for processing livestock.  
- **Vertical Integration** – Owning multiple steps of the supply chain (birth to sale).  
- **Capacity Constraint** – A production bottleneck that limits sales.  
- **Fixed Cost Investment** – Up-front costs to build infrastructure.  


## Founder’s Perspective

**Role Play**

- Imagine you are **Will Harris III**, 4th-generation farmer at White Oak Pastures.  
- Your goals:  
  - Restore degraded farmland.  
  - Build a resilient, profitable family business.  
  - Revitalize Bluffton’s rural economy.  

**Key Question:**  

How do you define “growth” at White Oak — more animals, more land, or deeper ecological and social impact?  


## White Oak at a Glance

- Family farm since **1866**, Bluffton, GA.  
- Industrialized post–WWII, transitioned to regenerative in the 1990s.  
- On-farm abattoirs: **red meat (2008)** and **poultry (2011)**.  
- Vertically integrated: beef, poultry, pork, eggs, hides/leather, compost, ecotourism.  
- Three pillars: **animal welfare, land regeneration, rural revival**.  


## The Founder, Will Harris III

- Rejected chemical inputs and confined feeding systems of his father’s generation.  
- Instituted rotational multi-species grazing.  
- Invested heavily to process on site and own the supply chain.  
- Passionate about jobs and wages in Bluffton, not just soil health.

How do Harris’s values and family legacy influence the risks he takes?

## Decision #1: Transition to Regenerative Practices

- Benefits: Soil restoration, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, brand story.  
- Risks: Higher costs, reduced automation, niche market, price premium required.  

::: {.callout-tip title="Discussion Prompt"}
Would you have made the same choice to abandon industrial practices? Why or why not?  
:::


## Decision #2: Build On-Site Processing Facility

- 2007: Local processor capped capacity, unwilling to expand.  
- Harris’s options:  
  - Plateau sales.  
  - Find a new external processor.  
  - Borrow $2.5M+ to build on-farm abattoir.  

**Outcome:** Built both red meat and poultry abattoirs, rare in the U.S.  


## Strategic Dilemmas

- **Financial:** Heavy reinvestment, debt load.  
- **Environmental:** Leader in regenerative grazing, carbon-negative beef.  
- **Market:** Competing with cheap conventional beef + alt-proteins.  
- **Community:** Rural revival through wages, jobs, and ecotourism.  


## Compare Options: Farming Model

| Option                | Pros                                  | Cons                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Stay Industrial       | Lower costs, easier competition       | Land degradation, no brand edge |
| Regenerative          | Ecological leadership, brand premium  | Higher costs, slower growth   |


## Compare Options: Processing

| Option              | Pros                              | Cons                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Plateau sales       | Avoids debt, minimizes risk       | No growth, mission capped           |
| Partner externally  | Lower cost, less responsibility   | Loss of control, still constrained  |
| Build abattoir      | Control, differentiation, impact  | High capital cost, major risk       |


## Make a Recommendation

- Should Harris have transitioned to regenerative farming despite the risks?  
- Should he have borrowed to build the abattoir, or relied on external processors?  
- How do these choices shape the long-term definition of “growth” at White Oak?  


## Scorecard Totals

- **Regenerative Transition** → ___ / 5  
- **Industrial Status Quo** → ___ / 5  
- **Build On-Site Processing** → ___ / 5  
- **External Processor / Plateau** → ___ / 5  


## Discussion Points

- How does regenerative agriculture redefine profitability and sustainability?  
- Does building the abattoir strengthen or weaken White Oak’s resilience?  
- Can White Oak compete on price against mainstream producers?  
- How important is rural community revival to defining business success?  


## Key Takeaways

- **Values vs. Viability:** Ecological principles must be balanced with financial realities.  
- **Vertical Integration:** Ensures control but demands high capital investment.  
- **Redefining Growth:** Not just output, but soil health, jobs, and community well-being.  
- **Entrepreneurial Lesson:** Family farms can innovate by aligning tradition with sustainability.  

::: {.callout-note title="What Happened?"}
White Oak Pastures grew into a vertically integrated regenerative farm employing 175+ people.  
Its beef was found to have a 111% lower carbon footprint than conventional U.S. beef.  
Despite cost pressures, it became a national model for regenerative agriculture and rural revival.
