- Aim for business casual — neat, put-together, and appropriate for a professional setting.

- No need for suits or formal wear.

- Avoid overly casual items (e.g., pajamas, workout clothes).

- No hats.

- Jeans are fine if paired with a nicer top (collared shirt, blouse, sweater).

:::

## Today's Agenda

1. Review *Stirring the (Lobster) Pot — A Podcase with Luke’s Lobster*.
2. Meet with your *pods* (in-class) and work through the group activity.

# Part 1 <br> Case Overview

## Summarize the Case

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Luke’s Lobster is a fast-growing restaurant business specializing in sustainably sourced lobster rolls and seafood.
-   Founder **Luke Holden** built the company around quality sourcing, a consistent customer experience, and strong supplier relationships.
-   As the business expands, Luke faces decisions on how to grow without compromising values or diluting the brand experience.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/02_luke_headshot.jpg)
:::

:::


## Understand the Situation

Ask yourself the following questions:

-   What’s going on in this case?
-   Why is each detail in the case important?
-   Which big-picture themes (e.g., sustainability, brand integrity, growth strategy) are present?
-   Are there any contradictions or unexpected points?

::: {.fragment}

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Define the core conflict / decision"}

Should Luke’s Lobster pursue rapid expansion (e.g., scaling like fast casual peers) or focus on slower, values-driven growth that protects authenticity, sustainability, and brand integrity?

:::

:::

# Part 2 <br> Identify the Key Players

## Key Players

- **Luke Holden** – Founder and CEO

- **Ben Conniff** – Co-founder (marketing partner)

- **Fishermen/suppliers** – Multi-generational relationships, core to sourcing model

- **Restaurant staff & frontline employees** – The “shack” crews delivering customer experience

- **Customers** – Seeking authentic, sustainable seafood experiences

- **Investors (Quilvest/Jay Takefman)** – Expecting returns but aligned with stakeholder philosophy

## Other Important Players

- **Holden family** – Multi-generational lobstering background

> “My father was—had the very first lobster processing license in the state of Maine. So I grew up on boats, docks, and processing facilities. So this was in my DNA. The banking was really a departure from what my upbringing was.”

- **Whole Foods and distribution partners** – Expanding brand visibility

> “We’re able to recruit teammates that ultimately see the transparency of our supply chain… and then finding—aligning ourselves with partners like Whole Foods.”

- **Community stakeholders** – Waterfront redevelopment, sustainability initiatives

> “We put a lot of resources into redeveloping the pound, the lobster wharf component of it, so that we revived and attracted some of the best fishermen in Portland… What enabled us to reinvest in the working waterfront and build a sustainable work site for these guys was taking the condo that was at the end of the pier and turning it into a two-story, 150-seat, two-bar, full-menu lobster shack.”

# Part 3 <br> Gather and Sort the Evidence

## Gather the Evidence

1. [Crew Profiles (Luke’s Lobster Crew)](exhibits/02_Luke's+Lobster+Crew.pdf){target="_blank"} – Shows the diversity and personal connections of staff.

2. [Employee Longevity](02_Luke's+Lobster+Employee+Expected+Longevity.pdf){target="_blank"} – Data on how long employees see themselves working at Luke’s, reflecting retention expectations.

3. [Employee Survey Results](02_Luke's+Lobster+Employee+Survey+Results.pdf){target="_blank"} – High scores on culture (8.75), enjoyment (8.59), inclusiveness (7.95), and willingness to recommend Luke’s as a workplace (8.04).

4. [Food Source Transparency](02_Luke's+Lobster+Food+Source+Transparency.pdf){target="_blank"} – Vertically integrated, traceable supply chain; strong sustainability commitments.

5. [Company Purpose](02_Luke's+Lobster+Purpose.pdf){target="_blank"} – Clear mission centered on serving sustainable seafood, treating people right, and building stakeholder value.

## Sort the Evidence

The evidence from the case can be grouped into several categories that highlight different aspects of Luke’s Lobster’s operations and strategy:

- Employee culture: high survey scores, strong engagement, longevity data (1, 2, 3, 5)

- Supply chain practices: direct sourcing, sustainable certification, vertical integration (4, 5)

- Customer focus: brand authenticity, consistent “shack” experience (1, 3, 5)

- Investor relations: unique private equity partner aligned with stakeholder model (case transcript)

## Interpret Exhibits

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Core conflict / decision"}
**The core decision in this case is whether Luke’s Lobster should pursue rapid expansion or focus on slower, values-driven growth without compromising authenticity.**
:::

When reviewing the exhibits, connect the data directly to that decision:

- Employee Longevity (Exhibit 2): Shows how long employees expect to stay, which helps assess turnover risk and workforce stability.

- Employee Survey Results (Exhibit 3): High scores on culture and inclusiveness demonstrate cultural strength, which supports scaling.

- Crew Profiles (Exhibit 1): Reinforce the personal, authentic culture that differentiates Luke’s from competitors.

- Food Source Transparency (Exhibit 4) and Company Purpose (Exhibit 5): Highlight sustainability commitments and mission, showing how Luke’s differentiates itself in the crowded fast-casual space.

> **Discussion Question:** How does each exhibit push you toward one growth path over the other?

## Look for Insights from the Case Itself

In the *podcase*, Luke highlights several important lessons and turning points that inform his strategic decisions:

- Expansion mistakes (2018) show danger of over-relying on fast-casual clustering.

- Relationships with fishermen are hard to replicate → durable competitive advantage.

- Culture and values provide insulation against copycats.

## Applying the Evidence

- Employee-focused exhibits (1, 2, 3): Suggest that rapid expansion could strain culture and retention, so a measured approach may be safer.

- Supply chain & mission exhibits (4, 5): Show that sustainability and authenticity are central differentiators, best protected through values-driven growth rather than fast scaling.

**Overall:** The evidence leans toward slower, stakeholder-focused growth that protects culture and supply chain integrity while still allowing expansion through careful, mission-aligned channels (e.g., partnerships, grocery products, e-commerce).

## How Might This Evidence Inform Your Decision?

Taken together, the exhibits and podcase details point toward strategic considerations that can guide Luke’s next steps:

1. Strong culture + unique supply chain favor measured, stakeholder-driven growth.

2. Employee and supplier relationships are fragile if expansion is too rapid.

3. Investor expectations must be balanced with long-term sustainability.


# Part 4 <br> Compare Options

## In running a restaurant, why is it necessary to consider what the customer experience should be? {data-background-color="lightblue"}

::: {.fragment}
Customer experience in restaurants is directly influenced by the people delivering it — the employees. 

It’s not just about food quality, but also about how staff interact with customers, how motivated they are, and how consistent they make the experience feel. 

A strong, positive employee culture leads to better service, higher morale, and ultimately more loyal customers.

Ask yourself: *How does the way Luke’s treats its employees influence the experience that customers have in the shacks?*

:::

## Why are relationships valuable in Luke’s business? {data-background-color="lightblue"}

::: {.fragment}
Relationships with suppliers, fishermen, employees, customers, and investors form the backbone of Luke’s Lobster’s operations. 

If any one of these weakens, the business risks losing trust and stability. 

Long-term partnerships ensure reliable supply, motivated employees, satisfied customers, and supportive investors. 

Consider: *What happens if one link in this chain breaks down?*

:::

## How might a stakeholder perspective influence the way Luke’s Lobster operates? {data-background-color="lightblue"}

::: {.fragment}
Luke’s Lobster follows a stakeholder model, which means weighing the needs of suppliers, staff, customers, community, investors, and even the environment. 

This approach requires trade-offs: a decision that benefits investors might put pressure on employees, while prioritizing sustainability could limit short-term profits. 

The challenge is balancing multiple, sometimes conflicting, interests while staying true to the company’s purpose.

:::

## Apply Course Concepts

What have we learned so far:

- Week 1: Types of Entrepreneurial Ventures

::: {.fragment}
> Luke’s Lobster illustrates how an entrepreneur can start with a small, niche concept (a single lobster shack) and grow it into a larger venture that combines multiple models — restaurants, wholesale distribution, and branded grocery products. This helps us think about how different types of ventures can coexist within one business.
:::

- Week 2: The Entrepreneurial Mindset

::: {.fragment}
> Luke Holden demonstrates core entrepreneurial characteristics: passion for solving a problem (authentic lobster rolls in NYC), resilience in scaling while protecting values, and stakeholder orientation over short-term profits. His mindset shows how personal background and purpose can drive persistence through challenges.
:::

## Decide on the Criteria to Make a Decision

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Core conflict / decision"}
**The core decision in this case is whether Luke’s Lobster should pursue rapid expansion or focus on slower, values-driven growth without compromising authenticity.**
:::

Based on the company values instilled by Luke, what we recommendation can be guided by the following criteria and questions:

**Sustainability & traceability** 

::: {.fragment}
- Does this option maintain or strengthen the company’s commitment to sustainable, traceable sourcing?
:::

**Authenticity of product and experience** 

::: {.fragment}
- Will the customer experience remain authentic and true to the brand?
:::

**Treating people well** 

::: {.fragment}
- How will this decision affect employees, customers, and suppliers?
:::

**Long-term community impact** 

::: {.fragment}
- Does this path support positive outcomes for the community and industry over time?
:::

**Balanced profitability** 

::: {.fragment}
- Can the company remain financially viable while staying true to its mission?
:::


# Part 5 <br> Make a Recommendation

## Apply the Criteria

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Core conflict / decision"}
**The core decision in this case is whether Luke’s Lobster should pursue rapid expansion or focus on slower, values-driven growth without compromising authenticity.**
:::

Now, let's apply the criteria to make a well-informed recommendation:

☐ Yes ☐ No — Does this option maintain or strengthen the company’s commitment to sustainable, traceable sourcing?

☐ Yes ☐ No — Will the customer experience remain authentic and true to the brand?

☐ Yes ☐ No — How will this decision affect employees, customers, and suppliers?

☐ Yes ☐ No — Does this path support positive outcomes for the community and industry over time?

☐ Yes ☐ No — Can the company remain financially viable while staying true to its mission?


## Reach a Conclusion

<b> *Likely* recommendation:</b>

- Prioritize measured expansion that aligns with values.

- Explore new channels (wholesale, branded grocery, e-commerce) instead of solely more “shacks.”

- Maintain investor alignment by demonstrating long-term profitability through stakeholder-driven practices.

## Wrap-Up & Key Takeaways

-   Balancing growth with brand integrity requires careful trade-offs.
-   Strong stakeholder relationships are a competitive advantage, not just “nice to have.”
-   Consistency in customer experience is critical to sustaining loyalty and brand reputation.
-   Strategic growth decisions should align with both values and market opportunities.

# From Listener to Producer

## Podcast Project

In Luke’s story, notice how much came through in the interview format — we got insights about his background, values, and decisions in his own words.

That’s the power of a good podcast: the conversation draws out details that don’t show up in a report or article.

Now it’s your turn to think like interviewers and producers.

👉 [Review the Podcast Project Instructions Here](https://laurenchenarides.github.io/csu-arec-224/podcast/podcast-instructions.html)
