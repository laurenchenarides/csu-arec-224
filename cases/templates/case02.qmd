# Part 1 <br> Case Overview

## Summarize the Case

-   Founder Luke Holden built the company around quality sourcing, a consistent customer experience, and strong supplier relationships.
-   As the business expands, Luke faces decisions on how to grow without compromising values or diluting the brand experience.

## Understand the Situation

Ask yourself the following questions:

-   What’s going on in this case?

-   Which big-picture themes (e.g., sustainability, brand integrity, growth strategy) are present?
-   Are there any contradictions or unexpected points?

::: {.fragment}

**Core conflict / decision:**

- Should Luke’s Lobster pursue rapid expansion (e.g., scaling like fast casual peers) or focus on slower, values-driven growth that protects authenticity, sustainability, and brand integrity?

- How should the company balance stakeholder theory (suppliers, staff, customers, community) with investor expectations?

:::

# Part 2 <br> Identify the Key Players

## Key Players

- **Luke Holden** – Founder and CEO

- **Ben Conniff** – Co-founder (marketing partner)

- **Fishermen/suppliers** – Multi-generational relationships, core to sourcing model

- **Restaurant staff & frontline employees** – The “shack” crews delivering customer experience

- **Customers** – Seeking authentic, sustainable seafood experiences

- **Investors (Quilvest/Jay Takefman)** – Expecting returns but aligned with stakeholder philosophy

## Other Important Players

- **Holden family** – Multi-generational lobstering background

- **Whole Foods and distribution partners** – Expanding brand visibility

- **Community stakeholders** – Waterfront redevelopment, sustainability initiatives

# Part 3 <br> Gather and Sort the Evidence

## Gather the Evidence

1. Crew Profiles (Luke’s Lobster Crew) – Shows the diversity and personal connections of staff.

2. Employee Longevity – Data on how long employees see themselves working at Luke’s, reflecting retention expectations.

3. Employee Survey Results – High scores on culture (8.75), enjoyment (8.59), inclusiveness (7.95), and willingness to recommend Luke’s as a workplace (8.04).

4. Food Source Transparency – Vertically integrated, traceable supply chain; strong sustainability commitments.

5. Company Purpose – Clear mission centered on serving sustainable seafood, treating people right, and building stakeholder value.

## Sort the Evidence

The evidence from the case can be grouped into several categories that highlight different aspects of Luke’s Lobster’s operations and strategy:

- Supply chain practices: direct sourcing, sustainable certification, vertical integration.

- Employee culture: high survey scores, strong engagement, longevity data.

- Customer focus: brand authenticity, consistent “shack” experience.

- Investor relations: unique PE partner aligned with stakeholder model.

## Interpret Exhibits

When reviewing the exhibits, it is useful to identify what kind of information they provide and how it connects to the company’s challenges:

- Longevity data: helps assess turnover risk and workforce stability.

- Survey results: demonstrate cultural strength, which supports scaling.

- Transparency and Purpose: show differentiation in crowded fast-casual space.

## Look for Case-Specific Insights

Beyond the exhibits, the case narrative highlights several important lessons and turning points that inform Luke’s strategic decisions:

- Expansion mistakes (2018) show danger of over-relying on fast-casual clustering.

- Relationships with fishermen are hard to replicate → durable competitive advantage.

- Culture and values provide insulation against copycats.

## How Might This Evidence Inform Your Decision?

Taken together, the exhibits and case details point toward strategic considerations that can guide Luke’s next steps:

1. Strong culture + unique supply chain favor measured, stakeholder-driven growth.

2. Employee and supplier relationships are fragile if expansion is too rapid.

3. Investor expectations must be balanced with long-term sustainability.
