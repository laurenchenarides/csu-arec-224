## Today’s Plan

1. Understand the case story
2. Meet the key players
3. Gather and sort the evidence
4. Compare strategy options
5. Group activities: practice making recommendations

::: notes
Keep today’s plan simple. Tell students we’ll move back and forth between learning and group activities.

## Case Story

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **The Loving Spoon**: 40-year-old family-owned soul food restaurant
- **Location**: South Carolina
- **Transition**: Parents handing control to three daughters
- **Main Question**: Should the restaurant stay the same or change to compete?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/01_restaurant.jpg)

:::

:::


::: notes
Use simple language. Ask: “Why might generational change bring conflict in a family business?”
:::

## Activity 1: State the Problem {data-background-color="lightblue"} 

**In groups of 3 (3 minutes):**

- Write a single sentence: “The problem in this case is...”
- Define the core conflict of this case.
- Share 1–2 sentences aloud.

::: notes
Help students focus on clarity: What is the big problem here? Keep it to one sentence. The core conflict is are we loyal to tradition, or is it time to change?
:::

## Problem Statement

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Case Problem Statement"}
The Loving Spoon must decide whether to preserve its traditional model, modernize into an upscale concept, or pursue both, as it faces aging customers, stagnant beverage sales, and rising competition.
:::

**Expanded:**

The Loving Spoon, a 40-year-old family-owned soul food restaurant in South Carolina, is transitioning leadership from its founders to their three daughters. 

Although the restaurant is profitable, efficient, and supported by a loyal customer base, its customer demographics are aging, beverage sales are stagnant, and evening business is weak compared to trendier rivals. 

The daughters disagree on how to move forward. Do they keep the traditional model? Reposition as an upscale restaurant? Or try to operate both concepts?

At the same time, new competitors like Sweet Abby are already attracting longtime patrons. The family must decide what strategic direction will best balance tradition, customer loyalty, and long-term growth.

## Activity 2: Identify the Key Players {data-background-color="lightblue"} 

**In groups of 3 (3 minutes):**

Who are the key players in the case? What are their perspectives about the situation?

::: {.fragment}

- **Parents**: Believe in tradition, efficiency, and loyal customers
- **Kendra (eldest)**: Wants balance; sees risks of staying the same
- **Alexis (twin)**: Pushes for upscale makeover (new menu, bar, décor)
- **Sharai (twin)**: Wants two restaurants in one (traditional + upscale)
:::

::: {.fragment}
Also...

- **Competitors**: Attracting younger customers, especially at night
:::

::: notes
Keep this slide tight—students should quickly grasp who is who.

## Review the Evidence

The evidence we are given:

1. [Food and beverage revenue table, by year](images/01_exhibit01.png){target="_blank"}
2. [Historical revenue and customer visits](images/01_exhibit02.png){target="_blank"}
3. [Average customer age, compared with competitors, over time](images/01_exhibit03.png){target="_blank"}
4. [Capacity utilization by hour, compared with high-end McKenzie's](images/01_exhibit04.png){target="_blank"}
5. [Selected menu items with prices, compared with high-end Fried Green Soul](images/01_exhibit05.png){target="_blank"}
6. [Customer review of The Loving Spoon](images/01_exhibit06.png){target="_blank"}
7. [Customer review of McKenzie's](images/01_exhibit07.png){target="_blank"}




## Activity 3: Sort the Evidence {data-background-color="lightblue"} 

**In groups of 3 (3 minutes):**

- Review the piece(s) of evidence you are given
- Determine how you would classify each piece of evidence
    - Does it tell you something about operations? customer segments? market rivals? 
- Share your piece(s) of evidence & summary with class

::: notes
Call on a group to show how they sorted. Reinforce that categories help simplify complexity.
:::


## Sorting the Evidence

::: {.smaller}
| Exhibit   | What It Represents    |  What It Tells Us   |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1 & 2   | Profits                 | Strong and steady   |
| 2   | Beverages                   | Flat sales (but high margin) |
| 3   | Customers                   | Aging, not many young diners |
| 4   | Timing                      | Quiet at 9 pm while rivals are busy |
| 5, 6, & 7   | Market Position       | Prices are lower than competitors 
|           |                       | Rivals Sweet Abby-with a similar menu and vibe-is gaining local customers| 
|           |                       | Fried Green Soul and McKenzie's Backyard BBQ are new upscale alternatives |
:::

**Other Evidence:**

- "Moreover, buying the same foods in bulk weekly gives us food costs that are 5% lower than our direct competitors in town and 8% lower than restaurants nationwide. A simple menu, low employee turnover, and high productivity translate into labor costs at least 10% lower than rivals." (*father*)


::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Use these buckets to help you sort through the evidence:"}

1. **Money & Operations** (costs, sales, profits)
2. **Customers & Market** (age, timing, rivals)
3. **Strategy Options** (parents vs. Alexis vs. Sharai)
:::

::: notes
Encourage groups to practice organizing facts. This is a skill they’ll use in case work all semester. Highlight how each piece of evidence either supports “stay the same” or “change.”
:::


## What are the Options on the Table?

::: {.fragment}
- **Parents**: Keep things the same
- **Alexis**: Go upscale
- **Sharai**: Try both traditional and upscale
- **Kendra**: Needs to guide decision
:::

::: {.fragment}
What criteria will you use to determine which option makes the most sense for the family?
:::

::: notes
This slide should act as a simple “menu” of options for students.
:::


## Activity 4: Pick Criteria {data-background-color="lightblue"} 

**In groups of 3 (5 minutes):**

To facilitate this, each group will "role play" (you will be assigned to represent the perspective of one key player).

- Decide how to judge options. 

- The option you pick relies on having a clear goal in mind.


**Examples:**

- Keep loyal customers?
- Attract new, younger ones?
- Affordable to do?
- Easy or hard to run?
- Beat Sweet Abby?

::: notes
Ask pairs to pick 3–4 criteria and rank them. This helps move from opinions to structured thinking.
:::


## Pros & Cons

**Keep the Same**

::: {.fragment}
- ✅ Loyal customers, low costs
- ❌ Aging base, no growth
:::

**Go Upscale**

::: {.fragment}
- ✅ Higher margins, younger crowd
- ❌ Risk alienating regulars, expensive
:::

**Do Both**

::: {.fragment}
- ✅ Appeal to both groups
- ❌ Complicated to run
:::

::: notes
This slide simplifies the trade-offs so undergrads can easily compare.
:::


## Activity 5: Make an Informed Decision {data-background-color="lightblue"} 

Based on **your role**, what should Kendra do?

- Side A: Argue for “Keep the Same”
- Side B: Argue for “Go Upscale”
- Side C: Argue for “Do Both”

::: {.fragment}
After hearing all sides, what would **you** do?
:::


::: notes
Frame this as practice in making and defending arguments, not finding “the answer.”
:::


## Quick Vote

- Who says: **Stay the Same**?
- Who says: **Go Upscale**?
- Who says: **Do Both**?


::: notes
End with a poll. Emphasize that reasonable people can disagree, but structured analysis helps justify decisions.
:::


## Is There a Middle Path?

- Keep traditional menu + efficient model
- Add small steps: new drinks, small plates at night
- Light décor refresh
- Partner with community groups
- Test → Learn → Grow

::: notes
Explain this as a low-risk way forward. Stress: not the “right” answer, just one approach.
:::


## Wrapping Up

Key Takeaways:

- Review the setting, players, and context
- Organize the facts into categories
- Decide on criteria before choosing
- Determine if there are lower risk alternatives


## Next Steps

Now it's Your Turn:

- This week, your task will be to go through the *Case Companion Tutorial* and complete the corresponding assignment (submit via Canvas).

Close with a recap that is simple and easy to take away.
