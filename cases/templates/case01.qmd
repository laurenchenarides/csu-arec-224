## Today’s Plan

1. Understand the case story
2. Meet the key players
3. Gather and sort the evidence
4. Compare strategy options
5. Group activities: practice making recommendations

::: notes
Keep today’s plan simple. Tell students we’ll move back and forth between learning and group activities.
:::


## Case Story

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **The Loving Spoon**: 40-year-old family-owned soul food restaurant
- **Location**: South Carolina
- **Transition**: Parents handing control to three daughters
- **Main Question**: Should the restaurant stay the same or change to compete?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/01_restaurant.jpg)

:::

:::


::: notes
Use simple language. Ask: “Why might generational change bring conflict in a family business?”
:::


## Key Players

- **Parents**: Believe in tradition, efficiency, and loyal customers
- **Kendra (eldest)**: Wants balance; sees risks of staying the same
- **Alexis (twin)**: Pushes for upscale makeover (new menu, bar, décor)
- **Sharai (twin)**: Wants two restaurants in one (traditional + upscale)

Also...

- **Competitors**: Attracting younger customers, especially at night

::: notes
Keep this slide tight—students should quickly grasp who is who.
:::


## What We Know

- Profits: Strong and steady
- Costs: Lower than competitors
- Customers: Aging, not many young diners
- Beverages: Flat sales (but high margin)
- Timing: Quiet at 9 pm while rivals are busy
- Rivals: Sweet Abby-with a similar menu and vibe-is gaining local customers, Fried Green Soul and McKenzie's Backyard BBQ are new upscale alternatives 

::: notes
Highlight how each piece of evidence either supports “stay the same” or “change.”
:::


## Activity 1: State the Problem

**In groups of 3 (3 minutes):**

- Write a single sentence: “The problem in this case is...”
- Define the core conflict of this case.
- Share 1–2 sentences aloud

::: notes
Help students focus on clarity: What is the big problem here? Keep it to one sentence. The core conflict is are we loyal to tradition, or is it time to change?
:::


## Sorting the Evidence

The evidence we are given:

1. [Food and beverage revenue table, by year](images/01_exhibit01.png){target="_blank"}
2. [Historical revenue and customer visits](images/01_exhibit02.png){target="_blank"}
3. [Average customer age, compared with competitors, over time](images/01_exhibit03.png){target="_blank"}
4. [Capacity utilization by hour, compared with high-end McKenzie's](images/01_exhibit04.png){target="_blank"}
5. [Selected menu items with prices, compared with high-end Fried Green Soul](images/01_exhibit05.png){target="_blank"}
6. [Customer review of The Loving Spoon](images/01_exhibit06.png){target="_blank"}
7. [Customer review of McKenzie's](images/01_exhibit07.png){target="_blank"}


## Activity 2: Evidence Buckets

**In groups of 3 (3 minutes):**

- Review each piece of evidence
- Determine how you would classify each piece of evidence-how would you bucket them?
- Share your categories with class

::: notes
Call on a group to show how they sorted. Reinforce that categories help simplify complexity.
:::


## Sorting the Evidence

**Buckets:**

1. **Money & Operations** (costs, sales, profits)
2. **Customers & Market** (age, timing, rivals)
3. **Strategy Options** (parents vs. Alexis vs. Sharai)

::: notes
Encourage groups to practice organizing facts. This is a skill they’ll use in case work all semester.
:::


## What are the Options on the Table?

::: {.fragment}
- **Parents**: Keep things the same
- **Alexis**: Go upscale
- **Sharai**: Try both traditional and upscale
- **Kendra**: Needs to guide decision
:::

::: {.fragment}
What criteria will you use to determine which option makes the most sense for the family?
:::

::: notes
This slide should act as a simple “menu” of options for students.
:::


## Activity 3: Pick Criteria

**In groups of 3 (3 minutes):**

Decide how to judge options. The option you pick relies on having a clear goal in mind.

Examples:

- Keep loyal customers?
- Attract new, younger ones?
- Affordable to do?
- Easy or hard to run?
- Beat Sweet Abby?

::: notes
Ask pairs to pick 3–4 criteria and rank them. This helps move from opinions to structured thinking.
:::


## Pros & Cons

**Keep the Same**

::: {.fragment}
- ✅ Loyal customers, low costs
- ❌ Aging base, no growth
:::

**Go Upscale**

::: {.fragment}
- ✅ Higher margins, younger crowd
- ❌ Risk alienating regulars, expensive
:::

**Do Both**

::: {.fragment}
- ✅ Appeal to both groups
- ❌ Complicated to run
:::

::: notes
This slide simplifies the trade-offs so undergrads can easily compare.
:::


## Activity 4: Make an Informed Decision

- Side A: Argue for “Keep the Same”
- Side B: Argue for “Go Upscale”
- Side C: Argue for “Do Both”

::: notes
Frame this as practice in making and defending arguments, not finding “the answer.”
:::


## Quick Vote

- Who says: **Stay the Same**?
- Who says: **Go Upscale**?
- Who says: **Do Both**?


::: notes
End with a poll. Emphasize that reasonable people can disagree, but structured analysis helps justify decisions.
:::


## Is There a Middle Path?

- Keep traditional menu + efficient model
- Add small steps: new drinks, small plates at night
- Light décor refresh
- Partner with community groups
- Test → Learn → Grow

::: notes
Explain this as a low-risk way forward. Stress: not the “right” answer, just one approach.
:::


## Wrapping Up

Key Takeaways:

- Review the setting, players, and context
- Organize the facts into categories
- Decide on criteria before choosing
- Determine if there are lower risk alternatives


Now it's Your Turn:

- This week, your task will be to go through the *Case Companion* Tutorial and take the corresponding quiz.

::: notes
Close with a recap that is simple and easy to take away.
