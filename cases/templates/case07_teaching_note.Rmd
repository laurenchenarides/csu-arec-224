## Today's Agenda

1. Case Discussion: Hyde et al. (2023), *Sunōmi Switchel: Time to Switch?* — led by **Team E**.  
2. Focus on two key entrepreneurial decisions:  
   - Whether to **raise outside capital** or continue **bootstrapping**.  
   - Whether the founder, **Nikki Blank**, should **stay with Sunōmi or switch careers**.  
3. Connect case insights to this week’s concepts on **sources of capital**, **entrepreneurial risk**, and **growth trade-offs**.  


## Teaching Note for In-Class Framing

**Goal:** Encourage students to see how financing choices reflect not just numbers, but also founder values, risk tolerance, and the realities of scaling a mission-driven venture.  

**Connection to course concepts:**  

- **Week theme:** Sources of Capital and Financing Growth  
- **Core ideas:** bootstrapping, angel vs. venture capital, debt vs. equity, opportunity cost, and founder–market fit.  

**Discussion anchors:**  

- “What does success mean for Nikki?”  
- “How should she finance that version of success?”  


## Key Terms: Functional Beverage Market

- **Functional Beverage** – Drinks with added health benefits beyond hydration (e.g., gut health, immunity).  
- **Purchase Occasion** – When and why consumers drink the product (e.g., post-workout, hangover recovery).  
- **Velocity** – Rate of repeat purchases; the metric retailers use to evaluate performance.  
- **Co-packing** – Contracting with a third party to manufacture and package your product.  
- **Working Capital** – Cash needed to fund daily operations (inventory, production, logistics).

## Founder’s Perspective

**Role Play Scenario**

- Imagine you are **Nikki Blank**, founder and CEO of Sunōmi Switchel.  
- You started the business in 2017 after discovering switchel as a healthier alternative to sugary sports drinks.  
- You bootstrapped the company, produced small runs with co-packers, and built distribution into **Whole Foods, Giant, and Stop & Shop**.  
- After years of growth and burnout, you face a major decision:  
  - **Raise capital** to expand or  
  - **Switch** to a stable career in brand marketing.

**Your goals:**

- Create a successful beverage brand that aligns with your values.  
- Avoid overextending yourself financially and personally.  
- Decide what “growth” really means to you.


## Sunōmi at a Glance

| Year | Milestone | Key Takeaway |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 2017 | Founded in D.C., joined GoKitchen accelerator | Gave up 10% equity + board seat for $1 investment |
| 2018 | Launch at Glen’s Garden Market and Whole Foods | Proof of concept + brand traction |
| 2019 | Trademark conflict → Rebrand to Sunōmi | Legal & brand management challenge |
| 2020 | Expanded to Giant and Stop & Shop | Rapid growth, but limited working capital |
| 2021 | Stalled operations, burnout, job offers elsewhere | Strategic and personal crossroads |

> What does this timeline reveal about the tension between **growth and control**?  


## Founder Profile: Nikki Blank

- Background: Journalism + athletics (Tufts University).  
- Motivation: Replace unhealthy sports drinks with natural alternatives.  
- Strengths: Brand storytelling, persistence, authentic mission.  
- Weaknesses: Limited business experience, undercapitalized, emotionally tied to the venture.  
- External pressures: Family investors, co-founder exit, burnout.

> How do Nikki’s **values and personality** shape her approach to financing?  
> Compare to last week’s discussion of **entrepreneurial risk tolerance**.


## Decision #1: Raise Outside Capital?

**Context:**

- Orders from major retailers (Whole Foods, Giant, Stop & Shop).  
- Not enough cash to fulfill them.  
- Estimated need: ~$1.3M for national rollout.

**Options for Funding:**

- **Equity Investment** → Give up ownership for long-term growth capital.  
- **Debt Financing / Working Capital Loan** → Retain control, but assume repayment risk.  
- **Continue Bootstrapping** → Maintain independence but risk stagnation.

> Tie this to **Sources of Capital** from lecture:
- Personal savings / friends & family (initial phase)
- Angel investors and accelerators (GoKitchen example)
- Asset-based lending (receivables/inventory-backed loan)

> “How does each funding source shape strategic flexibility?”  



## Decision #2: Stay or Switch?

| Option | Description | Trade-Off |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Stay at Sunōmi** | Raise capital, quit job, go full-time | High risk, aligns with purpose, uncertain payoff |
| **Switch Careers** | Take corporate brand marketing role | Financial stability, less autonomy, end of founder journey |

**Key Question:**  

How should an entrepreneur decide when to persist vs. pivot?

> Have students apply the **Entrepreneurial Decision Matrix (EDM)**—compare risk, control, return, and alignment with personal goals.


## Strategic Dilemmas

- **Financial:** Under-capitalized, strained cash flow, limited runway.  
- **Operational:** Dependence on co-packers and distributors.  
- **Market:** Competitive functional beverage space dominated by kombucha and big brands.  
- **Personal:** Burnout and pressure from family investors.  
- **Ethical:** Responsibility to repay family loans vs. pursue personal well-being.

> “What non-financial costs do entrepreneurs face when capital is scarce?”  
> Draw parallels to our in-class exercise on **bootstrapping stress points**.



## Compare Growth Options

| Strategy | Pros | Cons | Source of Capital |
|-----------|------|------|------------------|
| **Raise Equity** | Scale fast, meet retail demand | Lose control, investor pressure | Angel or venture investors |
| **Take Working Capital Loan** | Maintain control, modest growth | Personal liability, ongoing strain | Asset-based lender |
| **Bootstrap / Stay Small** | Full autonomy, organic growth | Cash constraint, limited impact | Personal savings, family |
| **Exit / Switch Careers** | Financial stability, skill development | Ends entrepreneurial dream | N/A |


## Class Exercise: The Founder’s Dilemma

> Imagine you are an investor evaluating Sunōmi.  
> What would you look for before funding Nikki Blank?

Discuss:

1. What signals show founder readiness?  
2. What financials or traction would you need to see?  
3. Would you invest — and if so, under what terms?  

> This connects to the **entrepreneur–investor relationship** we discussed: alignment of values, vision, and risk appetite.



## Discussion Questions

1. What financing path best fits Nikki’s goals and constraints?  
2. How do her financing choices shape control, risk, and growth potential?  
3. How might her **burnout** influence rational decision-making?  
4. Should she prioritize **repaying her family** or **protecting her own wellbeing**?  
5. What lessons about **capital structure** and **personal sustainability** can entrepreneurs learn from Sunōmi?


## Scorecard Exercise

| Option | Founder Fit (1–5) | Financial Viability (1–5) | Market Potential (1–5) | Mission Alignment (1–5) | Total |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Raise Investor Capital | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Take Working Loan | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Continue Bootstrapping | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Exit / Switch Careers | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

After scoring each option, **defend your recommendation** in a short summary.


## Key Takeaways

- **Bootstrapping Builds Discipline:** But limits scale and speed.  
- **Control vs. Capital Trade-Off:** Every funding source affects autonomy and mission.  
- **Founder–Market Fit:** Passion matters, but stamina and systems matter too.  
- **Financial Literacy:** Understanding debt, equity, and working capital is vital for growth.  
- **Sustainability:** Success also means knowing when to pivot or pause.  


## What Happened?

- Sunōmi continued small-scale regional distribution but never scaled nationally.  
- Nikki Blank transitioned into a brand marketing role while keeping Sunōmi active online.  
- Her experience is now used in entrepreneurship programs as a model of **founder self-awareness** and **values-driven decision-making**.


> Emphasize that *success in entrepreneurship is multidimensional* — sometimes stepping away is a strategic decision, not a failure.
