For your final project, you will create three connected components that together tell the story of your mentor’s entrepreneurial decision:

1. **Written Decision Memo** (2–3 pages) — a concise, analytical narrative about a real decision your mentor faced. (80 points)

2. **Digital Story** (3–5 minutes) — a visual or narrated summary that introduces the business and the decision point for your mentor and peers to view before the networking event. *This is to be recorded.* (40 points)

3. **Peer Evaluation & Individual Reflection** — a reflection and assessment of your teammates’ contributions. (30 points)


## Purpose
Your project will capture a real decision point—a moment when your mentor had to make a consequential choice involving trade-offs, uncertainty, or competing priorities. This assignment allows you to analyze an entrepreneurial challenge, communicate it in both written and digital formats, and connect classroom concepts to lived entrepreneurial experiences.

## Networking Event Reveal
At the Mentor Networking Event on Thursday, December 11 from 5:00–7:00 p.m. in Nutrien 135, each team’s mentor will reveal what actually happened—sharing their real-world outcome, reflections, and lessons learned.

This live reveal will allow you and your classmates to compare your analysis with the entrepreneur’s actual decision, deepening your understanding of how entrepreneurs make choices in real-world contexts.

At this event, the winners of the "Best Podcast" and "Best Case Study" will be announced.

## Instructions

Please check Canvas for assignment instructions.

<!-- For this assignment, you'll develop a business case grounded in your mentor’s entrepreneurial experience. -->

<!-- Your goal is to present a real-world decision or dilemma they’ve faced—or one they could realistically face—framed in a way that invites critical thinking and discussion, much like the case studies we’ve covered throughout the semester. The emphasis is on clarity, depth, and relevance. -->

<!-- At the center of your case is a guiding question: -->

<!-- **What should the entrepreneur do next—and why?** -->

<!-- You’re not being asked to provide the final answer. Instead, your job is to build a thoughtful, well-researched case that helps others understand the decision context and weigh the tradeoffs. -->

<!-- ## Team Structure -->

<!-- At the start of the course, you were matched with a mentor and placed into a pod. Your **case competition team will be the same as your podcast pod**. You’ll work with this group throughout the semester—interviewing your mentor, learning about their entrepreneurial journey, and building a business case inspired by it. -->

<!-- Your task now is to develop a case rooted in your mentor’s real-life experience—a decision they’ve faced (or could realistically face)—and extend it with original research, thoughtful analysis, and creative framing. -->

<!-- Just like the cases we've studied, your business case should raise a meaningful dilemma and present enough context for others to discuss and engage with it critically. -->

<!-- ## Deliverables -->

<!-- Each team will turn in **three items** as part of your final case competition. These should be polished, clear, and based on your mentor’s real-world experience. -->

<!-- | Deliverable                  | What It Is                                           | What to Focus On                                                                                                                                     | -->
<!-- |-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -->
<!-- | **Written Case (3–4 pages)**| A short case study modeled after the ones we’ve read.| Provide background on your mentor and their business, describe a real decision they faced (or could face), and set up a dilemma with no “right” answer. End with 2–3 guiding questions. Do **not** include a solution. | -->
<!-- | **Live Presentation (8–10 min)** | A team presentation delivered during our final session. | Present your case in a way that brings it to life. Walk us through the situation, what’s at stake, and why it matters. Focus on clear storytelling—not on pitching your own idea. | -->
<!-- | **Slide Deck**              | Visual support for your live presentation.           | Keep slides simple and focused. Use them to support your story—not distract from it. You can include visuals, charts, or key facts. Avoid putting too much text on slides. | -->

<!-- All materials will be submitted via Canvas. Aim for a tone that’s professional but approachable. You’re telling a real story that should spark discussion, not solving it for your audience. -->

<!-- ## Structure of the Written Case -->

<!-- Use the following structure as a guide: -->

<!-- 1. **Title**   -->
<!--    A compelling and relevant title that hints at the decision/dilemma. -->

<!-- 2. **Opening Hook**   -->
<!--    Start in the middle of the action—a quote, moment, or decision point. -->

<!-- 3. **Background**   -->
<!--    Provide context on the business, mentor, and market environment. -->

<!-- 4. **The Challenge**   -->
<!--    What dilemma or opportunity are they facing? What’s at stake? -->

<!-- 5. **Data and Decision Factors**   -->
<!--    Include relevant information the reader needs to consider (e.g., customer data, financials, trends). -->

<!-- 6. **Guiding Questions**   -->
<!--    2–4 questions to guide discussion. (E.g., "Should they expand into wholesale?" "How can they balance mission with growth?") -->

<!-- ## Timeline and Milestones -->

<!-- This timeline outlines the key milestones for your **Business Case Competition** project. You’ll work closely with your mentor and pod throughout the semester. Check the [course schedule](../2025/schedule.qmd) for exact dates. -->
