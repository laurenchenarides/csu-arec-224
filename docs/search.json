    "section": "Academic Integrity",
    "text": "Academic Integrity\nAcademic misconduct (see examples below) undermines the educational experience at Colorado State University, lowers morale by engendering a skeptical attitude about the quality of education, and negatively affects the relationship between students and faculty/instructors.\nFaculty/Instructors are expected to use reasonably practical means of preventing and detecting academic misconduct. Any student found responsible for having engaged in academic misconduct will be subject to academic penalty and/or University disciplinary action.\nStudents are encouraged to positively impact the academic integrity culture of CSU by reporting incidents of academic misconduct.\nExamples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to):\n\nCheating ‚Äì Cheating includes using unauthorized sources of information and providing or receiving unauthorized assistance on any form of academic work or engaging in any behavior specifically prohibited by the instructor in the course syllabus or class presentation.\nPlagiarism ‚Äì Plagiarism includes the copying of language, structure, images, ideas, or thoughts of another, and representing them as one‚Äôs own without proper acknowledgment, and is related only to work submitted for credit. Also included is the failure to cite sources properly; sources must always be appropriately referenced, whether the source is printed, electronic or spoken.\nUnauthorized Possession or Disposition of Academic Materials ‚Äì Unauthorized possession or disposition of academic materials includes the unauthorized selling or purchasing of examinations, term papers, or other academic work; stealing another student‚Äôs work; and using information from or possessing exams that an instructor did not authorize for release to students.\nFalsification ‚Äì Falsification encompasses any untruth, either verbal or written, in one‚Äôs academic work.\nFacilitation of any act of Academic Misconduct ‚Äì Facilitation of any act of academic misconduct includes knowingly assisting another to commit an act of misconduct.\n\n\nEnforcement of Academic Integrity Policy\nOur motivation for rigorously enforcing a no-plagiarism policy is twofold: First, plagiarism is a form of theft. Taking someone else‚Äôs words or ideas without attribution is stealing someone else‚Äôs work. Second, copying someone else‚Äôs work does not fulfill the purpose of the assignment, which is for you to develop critical thinking and analysis skills. You demonstrate this by presenting your own, new, synthesis and analysis in your writing. Simply copying or paraphrasing from source materials does not demonstrate this, however insightful the source(s) may be. Good writing generates new knowledge. This should be your goal in this class, in other courses at CSU and in your career after you leave here.\nIn this course all written work will be spot checked for plagiarism issues by both instructors and originality checking software such as VeriCite. If you are caught plagiarizing materials you will receive a 0 for the assignment/exam/project, and depending upon the severity of the offense, an F in the course. All examples of plagiarism or academic dishonesty and will be reported to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services for additional disciplinary action as outlined in the student handbook under the heading ‚Äúacademic integrity/Misconduct‚Äù.\n\n\nPolicy on Use of Generative AI\nYou may use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) as a research assistant to help you solve problems and to help you understand the concepts used in this course. However, if you choose to use such tools, you are claiming the resulting work as your own, and you bear full responsibility for its accuracy and appropriateness. In your assignments, you must disclose if AI tools were used and how. Doing so may not harm your grade; rather, it helps me guide you in using these tools effectively to enhance your grasp of the material. Remember, generative AI cannot advocate for itself or provide proper attributions; it is your responsibility to ensure integrity in your work."

Counseling Services has trained professionals who can help. Contact 970.491.6053 or go to http://health.colostate.edu. If you are concerned about a friend or peer, tell someone at by calling 970.491.1350 to discuss your concerns with a professional who can discreetly connect the distressed individual with the proper resources (http://supportandsafety.colostate.edu/tellsomeone). Rams take care of Rams. Reach out and ask for help if you or someone you know is having a difficult time.\n\n\nSexual Assault and Violence Elimination\nCSU‚Äôs Student Sexual Harassment and Violence policy, following national guidance from the Office of Civil Rights, requires that professors follow CSU policy as a ‚Äúmandatory reporter‚Äù of any personal disclosure of sexual harassment, abuse, and/or violence related experiences or incidents shared with the professor in person, via email, and/or in classroom papers or homework exercises. These disclosures include but are not limited to reports of personal relational abuse, relational/domestic violence, and stalking. While professors are often able to help students locate appropriate channels of assistance on campus (e.g., see the CSU Health Network link below), disclosure by the student to the professor requires that the professor inform appropriate CSU channels to help ensure that the student‚Äôs safety and welfare is being addressed, even if the student requests that the disclosure not be shared.\nFor counseling support and assistance, please see The CSU HEALTH NETWORK, which includes a variety of counseling services that can be accessed at: http://www.health.colostate.edu/. And, The Sexual Assault Victim Assistance Team is a confidential resource for students that does not have a reporting requirement and that can be of great help to students who have experienced sexual assault.

This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning. If you are a student who will need accommodations in this class, please contact me to discuss your individual needs. Any accommodation must be discussed in a timely manner. A verifying memo from The Student Disability Center may be required before any accommodation is provided. I ask that students that require accommodations that are not met by the standard course set up to arrange a time to discuss the accommodation with me.\nThe Student Disability Center (SDC) has the authority to verify and confirm the eligibility of students with disabilities for the majority of accommodations. While some accommodations may be provided by other departments, a student is not automatically eligible for those accommodations unless their disability can be verified and the need for the accommodation confirmed, either through SDC or through acceptable means defined by the particular department. Faculty and staff may consult with the SDC staff whenever there is doubt as to the appropriateness of an accommodative request by a student with a disability.\nThe goal of SDC is to normalize disability as part of the culture of diversity at Colorado State University. The characteristic of having a disability simply provides the basis of the support that is available to students. The goal is to ensure students with disabilities have the opportunity to be as successful as they have the capability to be.\nSupport and services are offered to student with functional limitations due to visual, hearing, learning, or mobility disabilities as well as to students who have specific physical or mental health conditions due to epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, AIDS, psychiatric diagnoses, etc. Students who are temporarily disabled are also eligible for support and assistance.\nAny student who is enrolled at CSU, and who self-identifies with SDC as having a disability, is eligible for support from SDC. Specific accommodations are determined individually for each student and must be supported by appropriate documentation and/or evaluation of needs consistent with a particular type of disability. SDC reserves the right to ask for any appropriate documentation of disability in order to determine a student‚Äôs eligibility for accommodations as well as in support for specific accommodative requests. The accommodative process begins once a student meets with an accommodation‚Äôs specialist in the SDC.\nIf the student requires an accommodation for in-person exams/quizzes, they must arrange for the accommodation by the SDC Accessible Testing Center.\n\n\nUndocumented Student Support\nAny CSU student who faces challenges or hardships due to their legal status in the United States and believes that it may impact their academic performance in this course is encouraged to visit Student Support Services for Undocumented, DACA & ASSET for resources and support. Additionally, only if you feel comfortable, please notify your professor so they may pass along any additional resources they may possess.\n\n\nFood Insecurity\nAny CSU student (along with faculty and staff) who is experiencing food insecurity can receive support from the Rams Against Hunger program. Services include a food pantry, a meal-swipe program, pocket pantries, and in-person assistance with navigating federal aid eligibility. The RAH page includes numerous resources as well as county, state and federal programs which are described and linked.\n\n\nTitle IX/Interpersonal Violence\nFor the full statement regarding role and responsibilities about reporting harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and the retaliation policy please go to: Title IX ‚Äì Sexual Assault, Sexual Violence, Sexual Harassment.\nIf you feel that your rights have been compromised at CSU, several resources are available to assist:\n\nStudent Resolution Center, 200 Lory Student Center, 491-7165\nOffice of Equal Opportunity, 101 Student Services, 491-5836\n\nA note about interpersonal violence: If you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault, relationship violence and/or stalking, know that you are not alone. As instructors, we are required by law to notify university officials about disclosures related to interpersonal violence. Confidential victim advocates are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide support related to the emotional, physical, physiological and legal aftermath of interpersonal violence. Contact the Victim Assistance Team at: 970-492-4242."

    "text": "Diversity and Inclusion\nIn an ideal world, science would be objective. However, much of science is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. I acknowledge that many of the readings for this course were authored by white men. Furthermore, the course often focuses on economic principles, policies, and concepts that were mostly developed by white men. I have made recent edits to the materials to try to reflect a more diverse perspective. However, I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of science. Please contact me (in person or via Canvas) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials (I have a paper mailbox on the second floor of Nutrien if you are worried about leaving an electronic trace). I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official CSU records, please let me know!\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Vice President for Student Affairs is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities.

    "text": "A core component of this course is supporting your development as a professional. Entrepreneurship in this course is broadly defined‚Äînot limited to launching a business, but focused on building competencies that are relevant in many professional contexts.\nThe Entrepreneurial-Individual Development Plan (E-IDP) is designed to help you identify specific areas for growth, set goals, and reflect on your progress throughout the semester. Similar to an individual development plan in a workplace setting, the E-IDP provides a structured way to track how your entrepreneurial mindset and skills evolve over time. Your mentor will also contribute by offering formative feedback based on their interactions with you.\nThe E-IDP will help you:\nYour mentor will also use the E-IDP to support your development by giving you feedback on your development mid-semester and at the end of the semester. You‚Äôll each be working from the same set of entrepreneurial characteristics (listed below).\nüëâ View Mentor Instructions to understand what they‚Äôll see."

    "section": "Context and Setting",
    "text": "Context and Setting\nYou‚Äôll begin the E-IDP by identifying a few entrepreneurial characteristics that resonate with you. These are not technical skills, but qualities that influence how you work: things like vision, passion, or communication.\nOver the semester, you‚Äôll apply and strengthen those characteristics through specific activities in the course. Each course activity offers an opportunity to translate your mindset into tangible action‚Äîwhat we often refer to as skill building.\nThe activities may be the same across the class, but the lens through which you grow will differ depending on the characteristics you choose to focus on. That‚Äôs where the E-IDP and your mentor come in. Your mentor can help you unpack how your characteristics are showing up in action and where you might refine or redirect your efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jordan Analogy: How Characteristics Drive Skill\n\n\n\nJust like in sports, success in entrepreneurship‚Äîand in this course‚Äîisn‚Äôt just about having talent. It‚Äôs about how you develop and apply it.\nTake Michael Jordan as an example. He became one of the greatest basketball players not just because he could shoot well or run fast, but because of the characteristics that shaped how he practiced and played:\n\nCompetitiveness pushed him to train harder than anyone else.\nResilience helped him bounce back from failure (like not making his high school varsity team).\nLeadership allowed him to inspire and elevate his team.\n\nThese characteristics guided the development of his skills‚Äîlike footwork, timing, court vision‚Äîand made him better at applying those skills under pressure.\nIn the same way, your entrepreneurial characteristics‚Äîthe ones you identify in your E-IDP‚Äîwill shape how you approach and improve your skills throughout this course.\nFor example:\n\nIf your characteristic is personal agency, you might push yourself to take the lead in the development of your team‚Äôs business case presentation.\nIf your focus is problem solving, you‚Äôll strengthen that by navigating challenges during the weekly case study discussions.\nIf you choose communication, you‚Äôll grow that skill during the podcast interview, where you‚Äôll need to prepare, listen deeply, and respond thoughtfully.\nIf your focus is team building, the weekly case studies and final business case presentation will give you direct experience navigating collaboration.\nIf you‚Äôre working on creativity, you‚Äôll stretch those muscles through problem-solving during the business case design.\n\nYour characteristics give context and focus to your growth, just like they did for Jordan. The E-IDP helps you track that growth, and your mentor helps you reflect on it.\n\n\nFinal Thought\nIt‚Äôs not just about completing the assignments‚Äîit‚Äôs about becoming more aware of how you work, where you‚Äôre growing, and how to carry those gains into your future career.\nYour entrepreneurial journey in this course will be shaped by how characteristics + skills + practice come together. The more intention you bring to that process, the more you‚Äôll get out of it."

In this short clip, Will Ahmed, founder of WHOOP, explains how most people get it backwards: they look outward first for answers before doing the inner work of understanding what they truly care about.\n\nThe E-IDP is designed to help you flip that script. It‚Äôs a tool for tuning into your values and goals‚Äîso you can move outward with more clarity and confidence."

Whether you launch your own venture or work within an existing organization, entrepreneurship is about solving problems, creating value, and navigating uncertainty with creativity and resourcefulness.\nWe‚Äôll explore both entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship‚Äîwhat it looks like to lead innovation from inside a company, nonprofit, or public agency. These skills are relevant no matter where your career takes you.\n\nOur Learning Culture\nI want you to imagine we‚Äôre all part of the same organization‚Äîone where everyone‚Äôs success depends on how well we collaborate, share ideas, and support each other‚Äôs growth. That means:\n\nWe take initiative and hold ourselves accountable.\nWe celebrate experimentation and embrace failure as part of the process.\nWe give and receive feedback with curiosity and respect.\nWe build a culture that reflects the kind of teams we‚Äôd want to work on in the real world.\n\nMy goal is to help you connect what you‚Äôre learning to real decisions and real contexts. By the end of the course, you‚Äôll have experience identifying problems, framing solutions, testing ideas, and communicating your value‚Äîskills you can carry into any industry or role.\nLet‚Äôs build something meaningful together.\n\n\n\n\nImage quote: ‚ÄúThe best way to predict the future is to invent it.‚Äù\n\n\nAlthough this quote is often attributed to Peter Drucker‚Äîand occasionally to Abraham Lincoln‚Äîthere is no reliable evidence linking it to either. The earliest known use is from Dennis Gabor‚Äôs 1963 book Inventing the Future, and it was later popularized by Alan Kay.\nQuote Investigator"

It‚Äôs not about being reckless. It‚Äôs about being brave, prepared, and willing to grow."

    "text": "FAQs\n\nHow Can You Prepare for Your Podcast Interview?\nThe podcast interview will be student-led and conversational. You don‚Äôt need to prepare a script, but here are suggested prompts they may explore:\n\nWhat problem did you set out to solve?\nWhat was your ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment‚Äîor was it gradual?\nWhat challenges did you face early on?\nWhat business model did you choose and why?\nHow did you define success?\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\nHow do you see your business evolving?\n\nYou‚Äôre welcome to share lessons, numbers, pivots, and surprises‚Äîanything that brings your story to life.\n\n\nHow Can You Support Your Pod?\nAfter your introductory meeting, you‚Äôll meet your student group twice‚Äîonce mid-semester and once as they prepare for final case presentations. These are informal 30‚Äì45 minute virtual or in-person sessions.\nStudents may ask for your perspective on:\n\nCustomer needs\nMarket trends\nGrowth strategies\nCommunication and branding\nYour feedback on their evolving business idea\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúgrade‚Äù anything‚Äîyour role is to guide, challenge, and encourage.\n\nGuiding Student Growth: Your Role in the ‚ÄúE-IDP‚Äù\nEach student is building an Entrepreneurial Individual Development Plan (E-IDP) throughout the semester. This plan helps them reflect on and strengthen key entrepreneurial skills‚Äîranging from creativity and persistence to opportunity recognition and team leadership.\nAt Week 7, we‚Äôll ask you to submit a short feedback form (3 questions) based on your interactions so far. This is not an evaluation‚Äîit‚Äôs a chance to offer encouragement and suggestions for growth. We‚Äôll ask for a second round of feedback after the final case presentations in Week 16.\nYour perspective helps make this learning experience more real and more personal for each student.\n\n\n\nHow Can You Submit for Travel Reimbursement?\nIf you travel to Fort Collins to participate in the podcast interview or final case competition, we can reimburse you for travel-related expenses.\nEligible expenses may include:\n\nMileage (based on standard CSU reimbursement rates)\nParking costs\nMeals\n\nTo process a reimbursement, you‚Äôll need to complete a CSU vendor request form. üëâ Please let us know in advance if you plan to request reimbursement so we can set you up in the system and provide the necessary paperwork.\nBe sure to save any receipts for expenses you‚Äôd like reimbursed."
