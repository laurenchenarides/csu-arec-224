## Why Case Studies?

What’s the most efficient way to learn? **From experience.**

Case studies give you the **benefits of learning from experience—without having to live through it yourself**. You’ll get to analyze real decisions, real dilemmas, and real tradeoffs that entrepreneurs face, and use them to sharpen your own thinking.

Each case is an opportunity to build a **deeper well of experience** you can draw from in your own entrepreneurial journey.
