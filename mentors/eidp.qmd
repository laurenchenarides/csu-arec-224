A core component of this course is supporting your development as a professional. Entrepreneurship in this course is broadly definedâ€”not limited to launching a business, but focused on building competencies that are relevant in many professional contexts.

The Entrepreneurial-Individual Development Plan (E-IDP) is designed to help you identify specific areas for growth, set goals, and reflect on your progress throughout the semester. Similar to an individual development plan in a workplace setting, the E-IDP provides a structured way to track how your entrepreneurial mindset and skills evolve over time. Your mentor will also contribute by offering formative feedback based on their interactions with you.

The E-IDP will help you:

- Reflect on your entrepreneurial strengths and growth areas
- Track your development throughout the semester
- Receive feedback from your mentor based on real-world interaction
- Notice patterns in how you work and learn

Your mentor will also use the E-IDP to support your development by giving you feedback on your development mid-semester and at the end of the semester. Youâ€™ll each be working from the same set of entrepreneurial characteristics (listed below).

ðŸ‘‰ [View Mentor Instructions](mentor-instructions.qmd) to understand what they'll see.

## Context and Setting

You'll begin the E-IDP by identifying a few entrepreneurial **characteristics** that resonate with you. These are not technical skills, but qualities that influence how you work: things like adaptability, initiative, or perseverance.

Over the semester, you'll apply and strengthen those characteristics through specific activities in the course. Each one offers an opportunity to translate your mindset into tangible actionâ€”what we often refer to as *skill building*.

For example:

- If you identify communication as a characteristic to develop, the podcast interview is a real-world opportunity to practice that.

- If your focus is teamwork, the weekly case studies and final business pitch will give you direct experience navigating collaboration.

- If you're working on resourcefulness or creativity, youâ€™ll stretch those muscles through problem-solving during the business case design.

The activities may be the same across the class, but the lens through which you grow will differ depending on the characteristics you choose to focus on. That's where the E-IDP and your mentor come in. Your mentor can help you unpack how your characteristics are showing up in action and where you might refine or redirect your efforts.

Just like in sports, success in entrepreneurshipâ€”and in this courseâ€”isn't just about having talent. It's about how you develop and apply it.

Take Michael Jordan as an example. He became one of the greatest basketball players not just because he could shoot well or run fast, but because of the characteristics that shaped how he practiced and played:

- Competitiveness pushed him to train harder than anyone else.

- Resilience helped him bounce back from failure (like not making his high school varsity team).

- Leadership allowed him to inspire and elevate his team.

These characteristics guided the development of his skillsâ€”like footwork, timing, court visionâ€”and made him better at applying those skills under pressure.

In the same way, your entrepreneurial characteristicsâ€”the ones you identify in your E-IDPâ€”will shape how you approach and improve your skills throughout this course.

For example:

- If your characteristic is initiative, you might push yourself to take the lead in your teamâ€™s business pitch development.

- If your focus is adaptability, youâ€™ll strengthen that by navigating challenges during the weekly case study discussions.

- If you choose communication, youâ€™ll grow that skill during the podcast interview, where you'll need to prepare, listen deeply, and respond thoughtfully.

Your characteristics give context and focus to your growth, just like they did for Jordan. The E-IDP helps you track that growth, and your mentor helps you reflect on it.

**Final Thought**

Itâ€™s not just about completing the assignmentsâ€”itâ€™s about becoming more aware of how you work, where you're growing, and how to carry those gains into your future career.

Your entrepreneurial journey in this course will be shaped by how **characteristics + skills + practice** come together. The more intention you bring to that process, the more youâ€™ll get out of it.

## Instructions: How to use the E-IDP

Youâ€™ll focus on just **three** characteristics that feel meaningful or relevant to you right now. Youâ€™ll return to these throughout the semester:

| Week | What You'll Do         |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| 1  | Choose 3 characteristics. Complete your baseline self-assessment in **Canvas** and explain why you chose them. |
| 8  | Your mentor will complete a brief check-in assessment on your progress. Youâ€™ll review their feedback and update your E-IDP. |
| 16  | Complete a final self-assessment and write a short reflection on how youâ€™ve grown. |

You donâ€™t need to be "good" at something to choose it. You might pick something you want to strengthen or explore. The goal is clarity and growthâ€”not perfection.


## Entrepreneurial Characteristics

The table below includes commonly cited characteristics associated with entrepreneurial success. These are drawn from several sources, including the course textbook, *Entrepreneurship: Theory, Process, and Practice* (Kuratko, 12th Edition). Youâ€™ll use these to guide your self-assessments and reflection.

**How to Read the Table**

This table connects entrepreneurial characteristics to the specific activities you'll complete in this course. Each row represents a *characteristic* and shows how that trait might show up as a *skill* in different contexts: analyzing a case study, developing a case presentation, or producing a podcast. You donâ€™t have to master every characteristic, but this framework can help you become more aware of your strengths and growth areas. As you move through the semester, use this table to reflect on how youâ€™re engaging, not just what youâ€™re doingâ€”these are the habits that will carry forward into your future career.

| Characteristic | Description | Case Study Example | Case Competition Example | Podcast Example |

| Internal Locus of Control   | Believes success comes from personal responsibility and effort, not luck. | Owns their role in a group projectâ€”even if things go wrongâ€”and makes improvements. | Steps up to lead part of the business plan rather than waiting for direction. | Volunteers to manage post-production or write the episode summary without being asked. |

:::{.callout-note icon=false title="Table 2.1 Characteristics Often Attributed to Entrepreneurs" collapse=true}

Researchers have identified a wide range of entrepreneurial characteristics, many of which can be grouped into a smaller set of core traits, as listed above. Howard Stevenson and David Gumpert identified traits like imagination, flexibility, and risk tolerance as central to entrepreneurial thinking. William Gartner found that the literature highlights a broad and diverse set of characteristics. Meanwhile, John Hornaday reviewed multiple sources to create a widely used list of 42 traits commonly associated with entrepreneurs, summarized in the table below.

For this course, weâ€™ll focus on a selected subset of entrepreneurial characteristics drawn from across the literature. These characteristics represent a synthesis of recurring themes and serve as a foundation for your E-IDP.
