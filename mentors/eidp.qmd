A core component of this course is supporting your development as a professional. The Entrepreneurial Individual Development Plan (E-IDP) is designed to help you identify specific areas for growth, set goals, and reflect on your progress throughout the semester.

Similar to an individual development plan in a workplace setting, the E-IDP provides a structured way to track how your entrepreneurial mindset and skills evolve over time. Your mentor will also contribute by offering formative feedback based on their interactions with you.

Entrepreneurship in this course is broadly definedâ€”not limited to launching a business, but focused on building competencies that are relevant in many professional contexts. The E-IDP will help you:

- Reflect on your entrepreneurial strengths and growth areas
- Track your development throughout the semester
- Receive feedback from your mentor based on real-world interaction
- Notice patterns in how you work and learn

Your mentor will also use the E-IDP to support your development by giving you feedback on your development mid-semester and at the end of the semester. Youâ€™ll each be working from the same set of 42 entrepreneurial characteristics (listed below).

ðŸ‘‰ [View Mentor Instructions](mentor-instructions.qmd) to understand what they'll see.

## Instructions: How to use the E-IDP

Youâ€™ll focus on just **three** characteristics that feel meaningful or relevant to you right now. Youâ€™ll return to these throughout the semester:

| Week | What You'll Do         |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| 1  | Choose 3 characteristics. Complete your baseline self-assessment **in Canvas** and explain why you chose them. |
| 8  | Your mentor will complete a brief check-in assessment on your progress. Youâ€™ll review their feedback and update your E-IDP. |
| 16  | Complete a final self-assessment and write a short reflection on how youâ€™ve grown. |

You donâ€™t need to be "good" at something to choose it. You might pick something you want to strengthen or explore. The goal is clarity and growthâ€”not perfection.


## Entrepreneurial Characteristics

The table below includes 42 personal characteristics associated with entrepreneurial success. These are drawn from Kuratko's *Entrepreneurship: Theory, Process, and Practice* (12th Edition). Youâ€™ll use these to guide your self-assessments and reflection.

## Why It Matters

Entrepreneurship is not just about starting businessesâ€”it's about being someone who takes initiative, solves problems creatively, and works well with others to turn ideas into action.

The E-IDP is designed to help you **notice how you grow**, and give you structured support along the way.
