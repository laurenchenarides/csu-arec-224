A core component of this course is supporting your development as a professional. Entrepreneurship in this course is broadly definedâ€”not limited to launching a business, but focused on building competencies that are relevant in many professional contexts.

The Entrepreneurial-Individual Development Plan (E-IDP) is designed to help you identify specific areas for growth, set goals, and reflect on your progress throughout the semester. Similar to an individual development plan in a workplace setting, the E-IDP provides a structured way to track how your entrepreneurial mindset and skills evolve over time. Your mentor will also contribute by offering formative feedback based on their interactions with you.

The E-IDP will help you:

- Reflect on your entrepreneurial strengths and growth areas
- Track your development throughout the semester
- Receive feedback from your mentor based on real-world interaction
- Notice patterns in how you work and learn

Your mentor will also use the E-IDP to support your development by giving you feedback on your development mid-semester and at the end of the semester. Youâ€™ll each be working from the same set of entrepreneurial characteristics (listed below).

ðŸ‘‰ [View Mentor Instructions](mentor-instructions.qmd) to understand what they'll see.

## Context and Setting

You'll begin the E-IDP by identifying a few entrepreneurial **characteristics** that resonate with you. These are not technical skills, but qualities that influence how you work: things like vision, passion, or communication.

Over the semester, you'll apply and strengthen those characteristics through specific activities in the course. Each course activity offers an opportunity to translate your mindset into tangible actionâ€”what we often refer to as *skill building*.

The activities may be the same across the class, but the lens through which you grow will differ depending on the characteristics you choose to focus on. That's where the E-IDP and your mentor come in. Your mentor can help you unpack how your characteristics are showing up in action and where you might refine or redirect your efforts.

Just like in sports, success in entrepreneurshipâ€”and in this courseâ€”isn't just about having talent. It's about how you develop and apply it.

Take Michael Jordan as an example. He became one of the greatest basketball players not just because he could shoot well or run fast, but because of the characteristics that shaped how he practiced and played:

- Competitiveness pushed him to train harder than anyone else.

- Resilience helped him bounce back from failure (like not making his high school varsity team).

- Leadership allowed him to inspire and elevate his team.

These characteristics guided the development of his skillsâ€”like footwork, timing, court visionâ€”and made him better at applying those skills under pressure.

In the same way, your entrepreneurial characteristicsâ€”the ones you identify in your E-IDPâ€”will shape how you approach and improve your skills throughout this course.

For example:

- If your characteristic is *personal agency*, you might push yourself to take the lead in the development of your teamâ€™s business case presentation.

- If your focus is *problem solving*, youâ€™ll strengthen that by navigating challenges during the weekly case study discussions.

- If you choose *communication*, youâ€™ll grow that skill during the podcast interview, where you'll need to prepare, listen deeply, and respond thoughtfully.

- If your focus is *team building*, the weekly case studies and final business case presentation will give you direct experience navigating collaboration.

- If you're working on *creativity*, youâ€™ll stretch those muscles through problem-solving during the business case design.

Your characteristics give context and focus to your growth, just like they did for Jordan. The E-IDP helps you track that growth, and your mentor helps you reflect on it.

**Final Thought**

Itâ€™s not just about completing the assignmentsâ€”itâ€™s about becoming more aware of how you work, where you're growing, and how to carry those gains into your future career.

Your entrepreneurial journey in this course will be shaped by how **characteristics + skills + practice** come together. The more intention you bring to that process, the more youâ€™ll get out of it.

## Why Inner Work Matters

Before you chart a career pathâ€”or even decide which opportunities to pursueâ€”it helps to pause and ask: What do I actually want? In this short clip, Will Ahmed, founder of WHOOP, explains how most people get it backwards: they look outward first for answers before doing the inner work of understanding what they truly care about.

The E-IDP is designed to help you flip that script. Itâ€™s a tool for tuning into your values and goalsâ€”so you can move outward with more clarity and confidence.

## Instructions

Select **three** characteristics among those listed below that feel meaningful or relevant to you right now. 

This list includes commonly cited characteristics associated with entrepreneurial success. These are drawn from several sources, including the course textbook, *Entrepreneurship: Theory, Process, and Practice* (Kuratko, 12th Edition). Youâ€™ll use these to guide your self-assessments and reflection.

You donâ€™t need to be "good" at something to choose it. You might pick something you want to strengthen or explore. The goal is growthâ€”not perfection.

Each row represents a *characteristic* and shows how that trait might show up as a *skill* in different contexts: analyzing a case study, developing a case presentation, or producing a podcast. You donâ€™t have to master every characteristic, but this framework can help you become more aware of your strengths and growth areas. As you move through the semester, use this table to reflect on how youâ€™re engaging, not just what youâ€™re doingâ€”these are the habits that will carry forward into your future career.
