## Vignette

Vision is your ability to connect today’s actions to tomorrow’s impact. It’s about working with purpose, imagining what’s possible, and helping others see it too.

In our class, this might show up when you interpret a case through a long-term strategic lens. In the podcast, it might mean designing an episode with a clear message or theme. In the business competition, it could involve pitching an idea that’s rooted in a deeper mission.

Vision gives meaning to the work—it answers the “why.”

## Design Your Practice Plan

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *vision* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice vision by framing our case analysis around the long-term effects of the company’s decision. I’ll prepare by researching industry trends. I’ll reflect by noting how the big-picture lens shaped our recommendations.

- I want to practice vision by designing a podcast episode around a central message. I’ll prepare by outlining the key theme ahead of time. I’ll reflect by seeing whether listeners picked up on the story arc.

- I want to practice vision by building our pitch around a future-oriented mission. I’ll prepare by aligning our solution with broader social or environmental goals. I’ll reflect by noting whether our audience connected with the bigger picture.

After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
