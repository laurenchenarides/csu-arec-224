## Vignette

Determination and perseverance are often what separate ideas from impact. They’re the grit behind the late-night revisions, the bounce-back after a rough critique, and the choice to keep showing up when things don’t go as planned. Entrepreneurs succeed not because things are easy, but because they stay the course.

In our class, this characteristic might show up when you revise your case submission after difficult peer feedback, rather than brushing it off. It might mean pushing through a team conflict or a disappointing practice run to deliver a strong business pitch in the final round. Or it could be sticking with your podcast episode even after a recording glitch or an unresponsive guest.

Determination doesn’t mean never struggling—it means choosing to try again with purpose. It’s about staying focused on what matters and learning how to persist with clarity and care.

## Design Your Practice Plan

Here’s a simple way to design your own action plan for this characteristic:

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *determination and perseverance* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice determination and perseverance by sticking with a tough case even if it’s confusing at first. I’ll prepare by scheduling time to talk through it with my team. I’ll reflect by journaling about how I approached the hard parts.

- I want to practice determination and perseverance by seeing my podcast episode through even if we have tech issues. I’ll prepare by building in time for re-recording. I’ll reflect by writing about what I learned from managing the setbacks.

- I want to practice determination and perseverance by leading my team through revisions after a weak practice pitch. I’ll prepare by setting a plan and checking in with teammates. I’ll reflect by asking for feedback from the mentor on what improved.


After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
