## Vignette

Drive to achieve is what turns a good effort into a great outcome. It’s the inner push to exceed expectations, not just meet them—and to hold yourself to a high standard, even when no one else is watching. This drive fuels ambition, builds momentum, and sharpens your ability to produce meaningful work.

In our class, drive to achieve might show up when you go beyond the case rubric to explore additional sources or propose an unexpected insight. In the podcast, it might mean preparing extra questions and refining your interview until it flows with polish. During the business competition, you might lead your team to rehearse again—not because you have to, but because you want to do your best.

Ambition doesn’t mean perfection. It means setting your sights on excellence and showing up with the energy and preparation to pursue it.

## Design Your Practice Plan

Here’s a simple way to design your own action plan for this characteristic:

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *drive to achieve* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice drive to achieve by setting a personal goal to exceed the case study expectations. I’ll prepare by reading additional articles and refining my argument. I’ll reflect by asking peers if the depth of analysis was noticeable.

- I want to practice drive to achieve by preparing a podcast script that’s tighter and more engaging than what’s required. I’ll prepare by editing multiple drafts. I’ll reflect by reviewing listener feedback and mentor comments.

- I want to practice drive to achieve by designing visual slides for our business pitch that impress both in content and delivery. I’ll prepare by researching good design examples and rehearsing transitions. I’ll reflect by noting how the audience responds and asking for input.


After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
