## Vignette

Strong communication skills are essential for effective leadership and teamwork. In the entrepreneurial world, how you express your ideas and how well you listen can make or break an opportunity. Communication isn’t just about being heard—it’s about being understood, adapting to your audience, and building trust.

In this class, you might demonstrate communication by clearly articulating your team’s recommendation during the fishbowl discussion, helping others understand your logic and evidence. During the podcast, your communication is on display as you conduct an engaging, professional interview that draws out insights and connects with the audience. In the business case competition, you’ll communicate your team's vision through a concise and compelling pitch, showing confidence, structure, and clarity.

Each of these moments offers a chance to grow your communication muscle: listening actively, expressing ideas clearly, and tailoring your message to the setting and audience.

## Design Your Practice Plan

Here’s a simple way to design your own action plan for this characteristic:

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *communication* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice communication by explaining my team's recommendation clearly during the fishbowl. I’ll prepare by writing a short outline beforehand. I'll reflect by asking peers if my points came through clearly.

- I want to practice communication by structuring my podcast interview to stay on track. I’ll prepare by mapping out a logical flow of questions. I'll reflect by listening back to the recording and noting what felt smooth or confusing.

- I want to practice communication by delivering a strong business case presentation. I’ll prepare by rehearsing with my team and getting feedback on delivery. I'll reflect by comparing how I felt presenting to how the audience responded.


After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
