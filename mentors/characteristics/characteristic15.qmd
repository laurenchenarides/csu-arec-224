## Vignette

Tolerance for ambiguity is the ability to keep moving when things aren’t clear. Entrepreneurs often make decisions with partial information—and learning to stay steady in the unknown is a valuable skill.

In our class, this might show up when you work through a complex case without obvious right answers. In the podcast, it might mean embracing unexpected twists in an interview. In the business competition, it could involve sticking with an idea before all the details are figured out.

Being comfortable in uncertainty allows you to adapt, take calculated risks, and grow from the unknown.

## Design Your Practice Plan

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *tolerance for ambiguity* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice tolerance for ambiguity by tackling a case that lacks clear data. I’ll prepare by breaking the challenge into parts. I’ll reflect by noting how I made decisions without full certainty.

- I want to practice tolerance for ambiguity by interviewing a podcast guest from a field I know little about. I’ll prepare by focusing on good questions rather than perfect answers. I’ll reflect by writing about what surprised me and how I responded.

- I want to practice tolerance for ambiguity by working on a business pitch idea that’s still fuzzy. I’ll prepare by experimenting with frameworks. I’ll reflect by journaling how the idea changed over time.

After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
