## Vignette

Calculated risk taking is about stepping outside your comfort zone—not impulsively, but intentionally. It means recognizing moments when a bold move could lead to deeper insight, stronger impact, or meaningful progress—and being willing to act when the potential reward outweighs the risk.

In our class, this might look like proposing a surprising solution during a case discussion that challenges the dominant view. In the podcast, it might mean inviting a guest with a controversial or unfamiliar perspective and preparing for a nuanced conversation. In the business competition, it might be pivoting your idea midstream to pursue a more ambitious opportunity—based on clear reasoning and a thoughtful plan.

Taking a calculated risk means you've done the work: you've weighed your options, anticipated possible outcomes, and are prepared to adapt. It’s not about being reckless. It’s about being brave, prepared, and willing to grow.

## Design Your Practice Plan

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *calculated risk taking* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice calculated risk taking by presenting a nontraditional interpretation of the case in our fishbowl discussion. I’ll prepare by finding evidence to support my position. I’ll reflect by asking my peers how it changed the conversation.

- I want to practice calculated risk taking by interviewing a podcast guest whose background or viewpoint is outside my usual interests. I’ll prepare by researching the topic and planning thoughtful questions. I’ll reflect by noting how I adapted during the conversation and what I learned.

- I want to practice calculated risk taking by presenting a business case that pushes beyond the original scope of our team’s plan. I’ll prepare by identifying the risks and how to mitigate them. I’ll reflect by tracking how the judges and audience responded.

After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
