## Vignette

Passion gives your work depth and staying power. It’s what makes you care about doing something well—not because you have to, but because it matters to you.

In our class, passion might show up when you speak with conviction during case discussions. In the podcast, it might be the excitement you bring to interviews. In the business competition, it might be the energy you channel into your pitch because you genuinely believe in the idea.

Passion is contagious. When you bring it, you inspire others to care, too.

## Design Your Practice Plan

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *passion* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice passion by showing up more visibly during case discussions. I’ll prepare by choosing an angle I care about. I’ll reflect by journaling whether I felt more engaged and energized after class.

- I want to practice passion by creating a podcast that genuinely reflects what excites me. I’ll prepare by choosing a topic I’m curious about. I’ll reflect by noticing if the conversation felt natural and lively.

- I want to practice passion by connecting our pitch to a mission I believe in. I’ll prepare by revisiting my personal values. I’ll reflect by noting whether my enthusiasm translated to our audience.

After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
