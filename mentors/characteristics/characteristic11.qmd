## Vignette

Persistent problem solving is about staying with a challenge long enough to work through it—even when it's frustrating or messy. It means breaking big problems into smaller pieces and trying different approaches until you find what works.

In our class, this might show up when you face a case with incomplete or conflicting data. In the podcast, it might mean adjusting your questions mid-interview to keep things on track. In the business competition, it might mean iterating on your idea until it clicks.

The key is resilience: staying engaged when things don’t come easy.

## Design Your Practice Plan

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *persistent problem solving* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice persistent problem solving by breaking down our case into smaller parts and assigning roles. I’ll prepare by drawing out a visual map of the challenge. I’ll reflect by noting whether the strategy helped clarify the path forward.

- I want to practice persistent problem solving by redirecting our podcast interview when it goes off-topic. I’ll prepare by planning fallback questions. I’ll reflect by noting what worked and what I might do differently next time.

- I want to practice persistent problem solving by finding a new angle on our pitch after hitting a wall. I’ll prepare by seeking outside feedback. I’ll reflect by comparing early and final versions of our concept.

After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
