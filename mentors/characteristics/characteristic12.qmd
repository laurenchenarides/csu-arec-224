## Vignette

Personal agency means owning your actions, choices, and outcomes. Instead of waiting for someone else to step in, you believe you have the power to make progress—and take initiative when things go wrong.

In our class, this might look like admitting when something didn’t go well and figuring out how to improve. In the podcast, it might be stepping up to manage production without being asked. In the business competition, it might mean offering to lead a section of the pitch and doing the work to get it right.

Agency is about knowing you make a difference—and showing it through your effort.

## Design Your Practice Plan

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *personal agency* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice personal agency by owning my part of a case that didn’t go well. I’ll prepare by identifying where I can improve. I’ll reflect by noting how my changes affect future results.

- I want to practice personal agency by managing the post-production timeline for our podcast. I’ll prepare by drafting a schedule and sharing it with the team. I’ll reflect by tracking whether we stayed on target.

- I want to practice personal agency by volunteering to lead a portion of our pitch. I’ll prepare by researching best practices. I’ll reflect by noting how it felt to take initiative and whether it helped the team.

After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
