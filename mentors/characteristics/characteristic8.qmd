## Vignette

Having a high energy level doesn’t mean bouncing off the walls—it means staying engaged, showing up fully, and being someone others can count on to bring momentum to a project.

In our class, this might show up when you’re an active presence during case discussions or group work. In the podcast, it might mean being genuinely curious about your guest. In the business competition, it might mean keeping the team motivated, even when you hit roadblocks.

Your energy sets the tone for others. When you bring consistent effort and enthusiasm, it builds trust and drives progress.

## Design Your Practice Plan

**Prompt:**

This semester, I want to practice *high energy level* by [specific behavior you will try] during [case study / podcast / business competition]. To do this well, I’ll prepare by [how you’ll get ready], and I’ll reflect on how it went by [how you’ll track your growth or seek feedback].

**Examples:**

- I want to practice high energy level by being a consistent contributor during our case group meetings. I’ll prepare by reviewing materials in advance. I’ll reflect by tracking my participation and asking peers for feedback.

- I want to practice high energy level by bringing curiosity and enthusiasm to each podcast interview. I’ll prepare by researching guests thoroughly. I’ll reflect by listening back to my tone and energy.

- I want to practice high energy level by encouraging my team when we feel stuck in the business case. I’ll prepare by checking in regularly with teammates. I’ll reflect by noting whether team morale improved.

After trying your plan, return to your E-IDP and reflect: What worked? What felt uncomfortable? What would you try next time?
