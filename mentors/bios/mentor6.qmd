**Background:** Nic graduated from Colorado State University in 2024 with a degree in Food Science and Human Nutrition. As a student, he worked as an undergraduate research assistant in CSU’s Food Structure and Function Lab and completed a brewery operations internship at Ramskeller Pub & Grub, where he helped lead recipe development for craft sodas and seltzers. These early experiences helped him build a strong foundation in food chemistry, product development, and ingredient functionality.

**Current Ventures:** Nic is currently a Research & Development Food Scientist at Bobo’s, a Colorado-based natural foods company known for its oat bars, snacks, and commitment to using wholesome, simple ingredients. Since joining the company, he has helped develop new product lines and flavor profiles, worked closely with procurement teams to source ingredients, and supported cross-functional innovation across R&D and operations. His work sits at the intersection of science, sourcing, and consumer experience.

**Expertise:** Food product development, formulation, ingredient sourcing, and cross-team collaboration in a fast-growing CPG (consumer packaged goods) company. Nic offers insight into what it takes to bring a food product from idea to shelf—from functional prototypes to commercial scale-up.

**Student Experience:** Students working with Nic will get a firsthand look at food innovation inside an established brand. His mentorship is especially valuable for students interested in product-based ventures, functional foods, or R&D roles in the food industry. Nic brings a relatable perspective as a recent graduate navigating his early career, with a collaborative, curious approach to solving problems and iterating new ideas.

**Fun Fact:** Before joining Bobo’s full-time, Nic helped brew craft sodas and develop small-batch beer recipes on a 10-hectoliter system—proof that good R&D starts with experimentation.
