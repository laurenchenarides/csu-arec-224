**Background:** Originally from Northeast Ohio, Jim grew up doing hands-on work on a family beef cattle operation while also developing an early interest in business and technology. He holds a B.A. from Muskingum University (where he pitched for the baseball team) and an MBA from Miami University. After graduating, he began a 30+ year career in tech, eventually rising to senior executive leadership at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).

**Current Ventures:** Jim recently retired as EVP & Chief Marketing Officer of HPE, where he led global brand strategy, product marketing, demand generation, and digital transformation. Over his 26-year career at HP/HPE, he helped launch HPE’s brand, built the case for GreenLake as a hybrid cloud market leader, and orchestrated the industry’s first keynote at Sphere in Las Vegas in 2024—drawing a record 14,000 attendees. He is now launching his own venture and exploring mentorship, leadership development, and global health initiatives.

**Expertise:** Strategic marketing, product development, go-to-market planning, AI integration, branding, and executive leadership. Jim is passionate about helping early-career professionals develop skills like asking great questions, working in teams, and building strong business cases.

**Student Experience:** Students working with Jim will gain exposure to the business side of innovation—from identifying growth opportunities to communicating ideas effectively. He’s especially excited to work with students who are curious, collaborative, and eager to understand how AI and technology are reshaping the business world.

**Fun Fact:** Jim played college baseball, lives in Colorado, and enjoys fly fishing, biking, hiking, and golf.
