## Required Readings

This course draws on two primary sources:

- **Kuratko, Donald F.** *Entrepreneurship: Theory, Process, Practice*, 12th Edition. Cengage.  
  This is our core textbook. Weekly quizzes will be based on assigned chapters.

- **Harvard Business Publishing Coursepack**  
  Includes all required case studies used for Thursday case discussions.  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Access Coursepack Here](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/1220179)

Both the textbook and case studies are required for full participation in the course. Additional readings and materials may be posted online throughout the semester.
 

## Assignments & Grading

Final grades will be calculated as follows:

<div style="width:600px">
Item                           | Weight | Notes
-------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------
Weekly Quizzes                 | 10 %   | 12 quizzes, lowest two scores dropped
Midterm Exam                   | 20 %   | In-class exam covering weeks 2â€“7
Case Study: Fishbowl Assignment | 20 %   | Based on your assigned fishbowl week
Case Study: Observer Assignment | 10 %   | Based on your assigned observer week
Case Study: Weekly Reflections  | 15 %   | 9 required + 1 homework assignment for the Case Companion in Week 1
Podcase                         | 10 %   | Team-produced episode and transcript
Business Case Competition       | 15 %   | Final pitch + written brief
</div>

All assignmentsâ€”quizzes, reflections, case write-ups, and project materialsâ€”will be submitted via **Canvas**. Deadlines and submission links will be listed in the weekly modules.

> Students will be placed in teams of four for both the podcase and the final business case competition. Each pod will be paired with a [mentor](mentors/mentors.qmd) based on preferences and interests. Think of this as a "mentor match," and youâ€™ll stick with this team throughout the semester.

### Grading Policies

- **Late submissions are not accepted.** Any assignment submitted after the deadline will automatically receive a zero.
- **Quiz Policy:** The **two lowest quiz scores will be dropped** when calculating your final grade.
- All graded components are weighted individually and not curved.
- Participation in both Fishbowl and Observer roles is required for passing the course.
