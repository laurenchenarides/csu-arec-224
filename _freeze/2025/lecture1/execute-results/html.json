Eatery** \n\nFounded in Denver as a single breakfast spot and grew into a regional chain with sustainability commitments and community engagement baked into its business model.\n\nCombines professional management and expansion with intentional values (e.g., waste reduction, local sourcing).\n\nUses operational scale but avoids a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù model.\n\n\n## Aggressive Growth Venture\n\nThese are high-growth, scalable businesses that often seek venture capital or rapid market expansion.\n\nEmphasizes innovation, rapid scaling, and market disruption.\n\n::: {.placeholder}\n![Plenty is an example of a high-tech vertical farm facility.](../images/01plenty.png){.uniform-image}\n:::\n\n## Example: **Plenty** \n\nA vertical farming startup based in San Francisco using robotics and AI to grow leafy greens in indoor controlled environments.\n\nBacked by SoftBank, Jeff Bezos, and others; positioned to disrupt traditional ag supply chains.\n\n\n## Special Case of Agressive Growth Ventures: *Gazelles*\n\n- A business establishment with at least 20 percent sales growth in each year for 5 years, starting with a base of at least $100,000 in annual sales.\n- Gazelles as leaders in innovation:\n  - Median growth of 450 percent\n  - Top-performing 1 percent of companies account for about 40 percent of jobs.\n  - Gazelles make up less than 1 percent of all businesses and account for 10 percent of net new jobs.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false title=\"Mythology Associated with Gazelles\"}\n- Gazelles are the goal of all entrepreneurs.\n- Gazelles receive venture capital.\n- Gazelles were never mice.\n- Gazelles are high tech.\n- Gazelles are global.\n:::\n\n## Special Case of Agressive Growth Ventures: *Unicorns*\n\n- A pre-IPO^[IPO=\"Initial Public Offering\"] (private) tech start-up company with a $1 billion market value.\n- In 2023, 1,191 start-ups were unicorns.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=false title=\"Decacorns and Hectacorns\"}\n- A ‚Äúdecacorn‚Äù\n  - Start-ups with a $10 billion or more market value.\n  - Examples: Facebook, Uber (taxis), and Airbnb (hotels)\n- A ‚Äúhectacorn‚Äù is valued at $100 billion or more.\n:::\n\n\n## The Case of Plenty\n\nAfter raising $1B in funding, Plenty filed for bankruptcy in March 2025.\n\n::: {.fragment}\nHowever, the company has re-emerged after company restructuring (as of May 2025).  \n[Read the PR Newswire article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plenty-undertakes-restructuring-process-to-support-focus-on-premium-strawberry-market-302408630.html)\n:::\n\n\n## What Bankruptcy Means for Plenty\n\n| **What it Means**         | **Details**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Out of cash**           | Plenty can no longer meet its financial obligations (e.g., rent, salaries, supplier payments). |\n| **Court protection**      | Bankruptcy gives the company legal protection from creditors while it reorganizes its finances. |\n| **Debts frozen**          | Debt collection is paused, giving the company time to develop a recovery or liquidation plan. |\n| **Equity holders lose**   | Investors (like SoftBank, Bezos Expeditions) may lose most or all of their investment. |\n| **Restructuring**         | The company may sell off assets, renegotiate contracts, lay off workers, or change its business model. |\n\n\n## What Bankruptcy for Plenty Tells Us About Agribusiness Startups\n\nPlenty raised nearly **$1 billion** in venture capital and still went bankrupt. That highlights:\n\n- **High capital intensity**: Vertical farming requires massive investment in infrastructure, energy, and automation.  \n- **Scale ‚â† success**: Being a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù (valued over $1B) doesn‚Äôt guarantee product-market fit or profitability.  \n- **Unit economics matter**: If the cost to grow and deliver produce exceeds what consumers will pay, it‚Äôs not sustainable.  \n- **Supply chain complexity**: Even with tech and AI, perishable products and logistics remain challenging.  \n- **Vulnerability to macro forces**: Energy costs, inflation, labor, and competition can undermine a well-funded startup.\n\n\n::: {.notes}\nPlenty's bankruptcy shows how even highly funded, high-tech ventures in agriculture face fundamental economic realities. It's not enough to raise money ‚Äî entrepreneurs need sustainable business models. In this case, vertical farming promised disruption, but its costs and logistics may have outpaced its revenues.\n:::\n\n\n## Do Most Entrepreneurial Initiatives Fail? \n\nData from the [*Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship*](https://indicators.kauffman.org/) shows that in the state of Colorado, the startup early survival rate is **81.95%**, compared to the national average of **81.70%**.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://indicators.kauffman.org/state/colorado\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n## \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<small> Figure plots the number of new businesses applications filed in Colorado (left axis) and the number of new business applications specifically in Agriculture (NAICS 11) & Retail Trade (NAICS 44-45) (right axis).

It‚Äôs helpful to reference when you start noticing how entrepreneurs are influenced by both their personal traits and their environment ‚Äî and when we explore business cases later in the semester.*</small>\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n  <img src=\"../images/01frameworks.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; max-height: 750px;\" />\n</div>\n<small>Figure depicts the \"Framework-of-Frameworks Approach\"</small>\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Key Entrepreneurship Concepts\n\n| **Concept**               | **Important Takeaways** |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Entrepreneurship**      | A process of innovation and new-venture creation across four dimensions ‚Äî individual, organizational, environmental, and process ‚Äî supported by networks in government, education, and institutions. |\n| **Entrepreneur**          | A catalyst for economic change who relies on purposeful searching, careful planning, and sound judgment in executing the entrepreneurial process. |\n| **Entrepreneurial Discipline** | The core principles of entrepreneurship apply across sectors ‚Äî business, nonprofit, public or private.
