Eatery** \n\nFounded in Denver as a single breakfast spot and grew into a regional chain with sustainability commitments and community engagement baked into its business model.\n\nCombines professional management and expansion with intentional values (e.g., waste reduction, local sourcing).\n\nUses operational scale but avoids a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù model.\n\n\n## Aggressive Growth Venture\n\nThese are high-growth, scalable businesses that often seek venture capital or rapid market expansion.\n\nEmphasizes innovation, rapid scaling, and market disruption.\n\n\n\n## Example: **P_____** \n\nA vertical farming startup based in San Francisco using robotics and AI to grow leafy greens in indoor controlled environments.\n\nBacked by SoftBank, Jeff Bezos, and others; positioned to disrupt traditional ag supply chains.\n\n\n## Special Case of Agressive Growth Ventures: *G_______*\n\n- A business establishment with at least ____ percent sales growth in each year for 5 years, starting with a base of at least $____,____ in annual sales.\n- G_______ as leaders in innovation:\n  - Median growth of ____ percent\n  - Top-performing 1 percent of companies account for about ____ percent of jobs.\n  - G_______ make up less than 1 percent of all businesses and account for ____ percent of net new jobs.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false title=\"Mythology Associated with G_______\"}\n- G_______ are the goal of all e______________.\n- G_______ receive venture capital.\n- G_______ were never mice.\n- G_______ are high tech.\n- G_______ are global.\n::: \n\n## Special Case of Agressive Growth Ventures: *U________*\n\n- A pre-IPO^[IPO=\"Initial Public Offering\"] (private) tech start-up company with a $1 billion market value.\n- In ____, 1,____ start-ups were U________.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false title=\"D_________ and H__________\"}\n- A ‚Äúdecacorn‚Äù\n  - Start-ups with a $____ billion or more market value.\n  - Examples: Facebook, Uber (taxis), and Airbnb (hotels)\n- A ‚Äúhectacorn‚Äù is valued at $____ billion or more.\n::: \n\n\n## The Case of P_____\n\nAfter raising $1B in funding, P_____ filed for bankruptcy in March ____.\n\n\nHowever, the company has re-emerged after company restructuring (as of May ____).  \n[Read the PR Newswire article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/P_____-undertakes-restructuring-process-to-support-focus-on-premium-strawberry-market-____.html)\n\n\n\n## What Bankruptcy Means for P_____\n\n| **What it Means**         | **Details**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Out of cash**           | P_____ can no longer meet its financial obligations (e.g., rent, salaries, supplier payments). |\n| **Court protection**      | Bankruptcy gives the company legal protection from creditors while it reorganizes its finances. |\n| **Debts frozen**          | Debt collection is paused, giving the company time to develop a recovery or liquidation plan. |\n| **Equity holders lose**   | Investors (like SoftBank, Bezos Expeditions) may lose most or all of their investment. |\n| **Restructuring**         | The company may sell off assets, renegotiate contracts, lay off workers, or change its business model. |\n\n\n## What Bankruptcy for P_____ Tells Us About Agribusiness Startups\n\nP_____ raised nearly **$1 billion** in venture capital and still went bankrupt. That highlights:\n\n- **High capital intensity**: Vertical farming requires massive investment in infrastructure, energy, and automation.  \n- **Scale ‚â† success**: Being a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù (valued over $1B) doesn‚Äôt guarantee product-market fit or profitability.  \n- **Unit economics matter**: If the cost to grow and deliver produce exceeds what consumers will pay, it‚Äôs not sustainable.  \n- **Supply chain complexity**: Even with tech and AI, perishable products and logistics remain challenging.  \n- **Vulnerability to macro forces**: Energy costs, inflation, labor, and competition can undermine a well-funded startup.\n\n\n\n## Do Most Entrepreneurial Initiatives Fail? \n\nData from the [*Kauffman Indicators of E_______________*](https://indicators.kauffman.org/) shows that in the state of Colorado, the startup early survival rate is **____.____%**, compared to the national average of **____.____%**.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://indicators.kauffman.org/state/colorado\" width=\"____%\" height=\"600px\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n## \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture1-handout_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<small> Figure plots the number of new businesses applications filed in Colorado (left axis) and the number of new business applications specifically in Agriculture (NAICS ____) & Retail Trade (NAICS ____-____) (right axis).

It‚Äôs helpful to reference when you start noticing how e______________ are influenced by both their personal traits and their environment ‚Äî and when we explore business cases later in the semester.*</small>\n::: \n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n  <img src=\"../images/01frameworks.png\" style=\"max-width: ____%; max-height: 750px;\" />\n</div>\n\n\n\n## Key E_______________ Concepts\n\n| **Concept**               | **Important Takeaways** |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------|\n| **E_______________**      | A process of innovation and new-venture creation across four dimensions ‚Äî individual, organizational, environmental, and process ‚Äî supported by networks in government, education, and institutions. |\n| **E_____________**          | A catalyst for economic change who relies on purposeful searching, careful planning, and sound judgment in executing the entrepreneurial process. |\n| **Entrepreneurial Discipline** | The core principles of E_______________ apply across sectors ‚Äî business, nonprofit, public or private. The types of innovation and where to find them are largely consistent. |\n| **Entrepreneurial Leadership** | Involves both the capacity to lead and the willingness to take risks. Measured through opportunity recognition, drive to innovate, and ability to accomplish goals. Increasingly important in the 21st century. |\n\n## Group Activity: Human Tic-Tac-Toe\n\n**Goal:** Get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) by finding classmates who match the prompts.\n\nHow to Play:\n\n- Walk around and introduce yourself to classmates.\n- Ask them the questions in each square.\n- If they match the description, write their name in that box.\n- You can only use each person once.\n\nFirst to get 3 in a row wins (bonus: try to fill the whole board)!\n\nAsk follow-up questions‚Äîget to know each other!\n\n\n## Summary\n\n- 1.1 Identify the major types of entrepreneurial ventures.\n- 1.2 Examine the historical development of E_______________.\n- 1.3 Summarize the myths of E_______________.\n- 1.4 Define the major schools of entrepreneurial thought.\n- 1.5 Explain the process and framework approaches to the study of E_______________.\n- 1.6 Paraphrase a comprehensive definition of E_______________.\n- 1.7 Examine the entrepreneurial revolution taking place today.\n- 1.8 Illustrate today‚Äôs entrepreneurial environment.\n- 1.9 Outline the trends in E_______________ research.\n- 1.____ Examine the future trajectory of E_______________.\n- 1.____.
