Case Discussion: Collins-Carey et al. (2020), *JUST, Inc.: Clean Meat and the Future of Protein Alternatives* — led by **Team E**.  \n2. Focus on the strategic choice among four paths:  \n   - **Enter clean meat** (cultured meat)  \n   - **Enter plant-based meat**  \n   - **Enter edible insects**  \n   - **Double down on plant-based alternatives** (status quo/core)  \n3. Connect to this week’s concepts: **industry life cycles**, **dominant design**, **go-to-market**, and **mission–strategy fit**.\n\n\n## Key Terms: Alternative Protein Landscape\n\n- **Clean (Cultured) Meat** – Animal cells grown in bioreactors to form edible muscle tissue.  \n- **Plant-Based Meat** – Texture/flavor engineered from plant proteins (e.g., soy, pea, wheat).  \n- **Plant-Based Alternatives** – Non-meat analogs (e.g., JUST Egg, mayo, dressings).  \n- **Edible Insects** – Protein from insects (e.g., crickets) whole or as ingredients (flour).  \n- **Dominant Design** – A prevailing product architecture that shapes competition.  \n- **First-Mover Advantage** – Benefits from early market entry before standards/leaders emerge.\n\n\n## Role Play: You Are Josh Tetrick (CEO)\n\n- Mission-driven founder with prior wins (JUST Egg) and a **controversial history** that raises reputational/regulatory risk.  \n- **Decision (2017)**: Where should JUST invest next to lead the protein transition?  \n- Constraints: capital intensity (esp. clean meat), regulatory uncertainty, consumer acceptance, and competition.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Prompt\"}\nFrom the CEO seat: What path best advances **impact + viability** while leveraging JUST’s **algorithm/R&D** and brand?\n:::\n\n\n## JUST at a Glance (Timeline)\n\n| Year | Milestone | Why It Matters |\n|------|-------------------|--------------|\n| 2011–2016 | Founding (as Hampton Creek), plant-based R&D & product launches | Built brand + discovery algorithm |\n| 2017 | Rebrand to **JUST, Inc.**; consider new protein categories | Strategic fork in the road |\n| 2018–2019 | JUST Egg scales; Minnesota facility enables 24/7 mung-protein extraction | Demonstrates ops scaling in core |\n| 2018–2020 | Accel in clean meat R&D across industry (e.g., Memphis Meats, Aleph) | Competitive race; rising capital needs |\n\n\n## Learning Objectives (for Students)\n\n- Evaluate **market attractiveness** across clean meat, plant-based meat, insects, and core plant-based alternatives.  \n- Assess **fit** with JUST’s resources/capabilities and **mission alignment**.  \n- Anticipate **go-to-market** hurdles: regulation, cost curves, consumer adoption, supply chains.\n\n\n## Market Snapshots\n\n### Clean Meat\n- **Pros:** Potential parity on taste/texture; large long-run TAM; ethical/land/water upside.  \n- **Cons:** High capex + R&D risk; regulation & labeling; consumer “lab-grown” skepticism; energy intensity.\n\n### Plant-Based Meat\n- **Pros:** Momentum + near-term growth; access to flexitarians; leverages JUST’s discovery platform.  \n- **Cons:** Strong incumbents (Beyond, Impossible); taste/texture arms race; late-mover risks.\n\n### Plant-Based Alternatives (Core)\n- **Pros:** Brand equity; proven ops scaling (JUST Egg); lower regulatory friction.  \n- **Cons:** Finite substitution space; supply chain build-outs for novel inputs; slower path to category leadership.\n\n### Edible Insects\n- **Pros:** Efficient feed conversion; niche demand growth; ingredient versatility.  \n- **Cons:** Cultural barriers in U.S.; fragmented field; far from JUST’s capabilities/brand.\n\n\n## Industry Life Cycle & Design\n\n- **Where are categories on the curve?**  \n  - Clean meat: **emergent / pre-dominant design**  \n  - Plant-based meat: **growth / design converging**  \n  - Plant-based alternatives: **growth / fragmentation by application**  \n  - Insects: **emergent / niche**\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Discussion Prompt\"}\nIf **dominant design** emerges in clean meat in 3–5 years, does JUST want to shape it or adapt to it?\n:::\n\n\n## The Strategic Choice\n\n**Options:**\n\n1. **Enter Clean Meat** (pursue first-mover potential)  \n2. **Enter Plant-Based Meat** (fast-follower vs. incumbents)  \n3. **Enter Edible Insects** (ingredient play, niche)  \n4. **Double Down on Core** (expand plant-based alternatives portfolio)\n\n\n## Connect These Options with Legal & Marketing Hurdles\n\n- **Regulatory pathways** → cultured vs. plant-based products\n- **Food safety & liability** → GMP, traceability, recalls\n- **Contracts & market access** → brokers, co-manufacturing, slotting\n- **Cottage vs. Commercial** → why JUST can’t be “cottage”\n- **Pricing & costs** → thin margins, scaling choices\n- **Brand & positioning** → dominant design and focus\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nGoal: Use Lecture 9 tools to evaluate **which path** (clean meat, plant-based meat, core plant-based, insects) best fits JUST’s mission, means, and market.\n:::\n\n\n## Regulatory Pathways (FDA/USDA)\n**Cultured meat (clean meat)**\n\n- Pre-market consultations, facility registration, inspections\n- Joint FDA–USDA oversight (cells → FDA; harvest/processing → USDA)\n- Labeling and nomenclature uncertainty\n\n**Plant-based**\n\n- FDA food rules (ingredients, allergens, GRAS, labeling)\n- Claims (protein quality, sustainability) need substantiation\n\n**Implication for JUST**\n\n- **Clean meat**: longer, costlier path; high policy risk\n- **Plant-based**: clearer path; faster channel expansion\n\n**Prompt:** If the **dominant design** in cultured meat is 3–5 years out, does JUST want to **shape** it or **follow** it?\n\n\n## Food Safety, GMP, and Liability\n- **GMP** is non-negotiable for national retail\n- **Traceability**: one-step forward/back, batch IDs, recall readiness\n- **Risk**: contamination, allergen control, supply chain failures\n\n**JUST Application**\n\n- Clean meat: aseptic bioprocessing, media control, QA/QC uptick\n- Plant-based: co-manufacturing + supplier audits; simpler—but still strict\n\n**Quick Check:** What **documentation** must JUST have in place before pitching a national QSR pilot?\n\n\n## Contracts & Channel Access\n- **Brokers/Distributors**: unlock retail buyers but take margin\n- **Slotting/Promotion**: trade spend planning matters\n- **Co-packing**: capacity, MOQs, lead times, quality specs, IP/NDAs\n- **Force majeure**: supply shocks, logistics, recalls\n\n**JUST Application**\n\n- Core/plant-based: leverage co-packers to scale JUST Egg–adjacent lines\n- Clean meat: likely JV/strategics for pilot plants + foodservice entry\n\n**Exercise:** Draft 3 must-have **contract clauses** JUST should demand from a co-packer for a new plant-based SKU.\n\n\n## Cottage Food vs. Commercial Reality\n- Cottage laws vs. wholesale/interstate\n- National brands require **commercial facilities** + audits (GMP/HACCP)\n\n**JUST Application**\n\n- All four paths require commercial compliance; **no cottage shortcuts**\n- Clean meat adds **bioprocess** validation and new SOPs\n\n\n## Market Access & Competition\n**Barriers**\n\n- Shelf space (category captaincy by incumbents)\n- Velocity expectations, cold chain, slotting fees\n- Consumer acceptance (taste, texture, name)\n\n**Playbooks**\n\n- **Plant-based**: fast-follower differentiation (protein source, nutrition, price)\n- **Clean meat**: staged foodservice launches; transparent messaging\n- **Core**: deepen penetration (foodservice + retail), capacity expansion\n\n**Think:** What is JUST’s “**Haribo focus**”? (One killer SKU or platform where it can dominate.)\n\n\n## Costs, Pricing, and Thin Margins\n- Rising inputs, labor, freight, trade spend → squeeze gross margin\n- Clean meat: **Very high capex/opex** until media yield improves\n- Plant-based/core: scale lowers COGS; ingredient hedging helps\n\n**Decision Lens**\n\n- Can JUST hit a **price-to-value** that drives velocity without burning runway?\n\n\n## Compare the Paths\n\n| Path | Strategic Fit | Capital Need | Regulatory Risk | Consumer Adoption | Speed to Revenue |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| Clean Meat | High (mission) / Medium (capabilities) | **Very High** | **High** | Medium (omnivores) | Low |\n| Plant-Based Meat | High | High | Medium | Medium–High | Medium |\n| Core Alternatives | **Very High** | Medium | Low | High (existing) | **High** |\n| Insects | Low | Medium | Medium | Low–Medium (U.S.) | Low |\n\n\n## Finance & Ops Implications\n\n- **Clean Meat**: Bioreactors, cell lines, scaffolding, media costs, QA; multi-year burn to unit economics.  \n- **Plant-Based Meat**: Ingredient supply (pea/soy/wheat proteins), extrusion tech, flavor science.  \n- **Core**: Capacity expansions, channel partnerships (retail/foodservice), brand building.  \n- **Insects**: Farming or sourcing, processing to ingredients, B2B demand development.\n\n\n## Class Exercise (Investor Lens)\n\n> You’re an investor hearing JUST’s pitch for **one** path.\n\n1. What **traction** or technical milestones must you see?  \n2. What are the **leading risks** and how are they mitigated?  \n3. What **terms/structure** (e.g., staged capital, milestones) would you require?\n\n\n## Discussion Questions\n\n1. Which path best aligns with JUST’s **mission–market–means** triangle?  \n2. How should prior **reputational turbulence** shape entry timing/communications?  \n3. Where can JUST’s **algorithmic discovery** create durable edge?  \n4. What **sequencing** option (now vs. later) best balances risk and upside?  \n5. If entering clean meat, what **partnerships** (bioprocess, regulatory, distribution) are pivotal?\n\n\n## Scorecard Exercise\n\n| Option | Capability Fit (1–5) | Market Attractiveness (1–5) | Risk (1–5, low=5) | Mission Alignment (1–5) | Total |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| Clean Meat | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| Plant-Based Meat | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| Core Alternatives | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| Insects | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n\n**Write 3–4 sentences** defending your recommendation and proposed next steps.\n\n\n## Go-to-Market: If Clean Meat Wins\n\n- **Milestones:** cost curve (media ↓, yield ↑), sensory parity, regulatory pathway, pilot plant.  \n- **Allies:** academic labs, bioprocess OEMs, strategic CPG/meat partners, advocacy orgs.  \n- **GTMP:** limited-scope launches (foodservice), transparent messaging, data on safety & sustainability.\n\n\n\n## Go-to-Market: If Plant-Based Meat Wins\n\n- **Differentiate:** novel proteins via discovery platform; superior nutrition or price.  \n- **Ops:** co-manu vs. owned lines; secure inputs; flavor/texture IP.  \n- **Channels:** QSR pilots → retail; chef partnerships; retailer category captaincy.\n\n\n## Epilogue (for Debrief)\n\n- JUST ultimately **pursues clean meat** while scaling JUST Egg; costs decline but commercialization remains staged; competitive field intensifies.  \n- Debrief: Was this **optimal sequencing** given capabilities, risk, and the market window? What would you do in 2026?\n\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Fit before flash:** Match path to capabilities, mission, and runway.  \n- **Design & timing matter:** Pre-dominant-design races reward crisp milestones and alliances.  \n- **De-risk in stages:** Sequence bets; protect the core while advancing the frontier.  \n- **Narrative discipline:** Reg- and reputation-aware communications are strategic assets.\n\n",
