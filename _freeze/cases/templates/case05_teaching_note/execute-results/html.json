Remember, the goal isn’t to find one “right” answer but to think through the founder’s choices, constraints, and what you would do in his shoes.  \n\n## 1. Founding Decision\nLet’s start at the beginning. Markus Berger was working at Google when he decided to leave and found Dinr.  \n\n- How well did Berger evaluate the market opportunity before launching Dinr?  \n- Do you think his opportunity assessment gave him enough confidence to leave Google? In other words, did he gather enough evidence (alpha test, survey, competitor analysis) to justify leaving Google?  \n- Were his financing choices (personal savings, friends/family, crowdfunding) sufficient for the scale of the idea?  \n- Did he recruit the right team to execute the business model? Why or why not?  \n- If you were his friend at the time, would you have advised him to keep working at Google or go ahead with Dinr?  \n\n\n## 2. Execution\nFast-forward to the first 18 months. Berger has limited resources, a part-time co-founder, and a very lean team.  \n- Given these constraints, how well did he execute his vision?  \n- Where do you think he succeeded? Where did he fall short?  \n- If you were advising him then, what would you have done differently with the business model, the team, or the financing strategy?  \n\n\n## 3. Action Plan\nNow, imagine it’s December 2013. Berger has just raised £20,000 from Seedrs. He’s on his way home for Christmas and reflecting on Dinr’s future.  \n\n- If you were in his position, what concrete action plan would you put in place?  \n- What would you do in the first week? In the first month?  \n- What specific metrics would you track to decide if Dinr is moving in the right direction?  \n\n\n## 4. Investor Communication\nOne of the distinctive things about this case is Berger’s openness with investors. He sent very candid monthly updates, even when things weren’t going well.  \n\n- Should he be showing “all his dirty laundry” to investors?  \n- At this stage, who does he need to please more: consumers or investors?  \n- How do you balance transparency with the risk of information leaking to competitors?  \n\n\n## 5. Shut-Down Decision\nLet’s imagine you come to the conclusion that Dinr should shut down.  \n\n- Why might you make that decision?  \n- How would you communicate it to investors? Would you go into detail, or keep it simple?  \n- What would you do with the £20,000 that was just raised?  \n- How would you explain a decision like, “I took your money and shut down a week later”?  \n\n\n## 6. Failure Reflection\nFinally, let’s step back.  \n\n- Did Berger “fail well”? What does that even mean?  \n- What lessons should an entrepreneur — or you as students — take from Dinr about testing ideas, understanding customer behavior, balancing design with fundamentals, and having the right domain expertise?  \n\n\n**Closing**  \nDinr didn’t become the next HelloFresh or Gousto. But Berger’s journey gives us a chance to ask: what does it look like to learn from a first startup? And what would *you* do differently if you were in his place?\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Case Discussion\n\nGhosh and Maslauskaite (2016), *Dinr: My First Start-Up*. Lead by **Team C**.\n\n## Key Terms: Startup Funding Stages\n\n- **Seed Round** – Initial capital to build product and test viability.  \n- **Angel Investment** – Early external capital, often from wealthy individuals.  \n- **Crowdfunding** – Raising smaller investments from many individuals online.  \n- **Accelerator** – Short-term program with mentorship, resources, and sometimes cash in exchange for equity.  \n- **Valuation** – Estimated worth of the company at a given funding round.  \n\n\n## Key Terms: Other Concepts\n\n- **Burn Rate** – Speed at which a startup spends its available cash.  \n- **Runway** – Months until cash runs out at current burn rate.  \n- **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** – Simplest version of the product that can be tested with real customers.  \n- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** – Cost to gain one customer.  \n- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** – Expected revenue from a customer over their relationship with the company.  \n\n\n<!-- # Framing the Case -->\n\n## Founder’s Perspective\n\n**Role Play**\n\n- Imagine you are **Markus Berger, founder of Dinr**.  \n- Your goals:  \n  - Prove the *on-demand meal kit* model works in London.  \n  - Raise money to extend runway.  \n  - Turn first-time buyers into repeat customers.  \n\n**Key Question:**  \n\nHow do you make Dinr financially sustainable before the cash runs out?  \n\n\n<!-- # Case Overview -->\n\n## Dinr at a Glance\n\n- Founded in **2012** by Markus Berger, former Google employee.  \n- London-based same-day **meal ingredient delivery** service.  \n- Customers ordered online; Dinr delivered pre-measured ingredients + recipe cards.  \n- Differentiation:  \n  - **On-demand orders** (no subscription).  \n  - Targeted **young urban professionals**.  \n  - Premium experience: recipe cards, surprise gifts, playlists, wine suggestions.  \n\n**Mission:** Teach people to cook quality meals at home with ease.  \n\n## The Founder, Markus Berger\n\n- Born in **Brno, Czech Republic (1978)**; trained as a lawyer at Vienna University.  \n- Early career: **consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton**, then earned an **MBA at London Business School**.  \n- Worked at **Google London (2008–2012)** in account management and business development.  \n- Inspired by **Jamie Oliver’s TED Talk** on teaching people to cook and by emerging meal-kit startups in Europe.  \n- Personal motivation: more passion for **education and improving lives** than for food itself.  \n  - Wanted to help people master at least **ten quality home-cooked meals**.  \n- Cofounded Dinr in **2012** with Atul Mahajan (part-time tech co-founder).  \n\n**Discussion Prompt:**\n\nHow did Berger’s background — law, consulting, Google, MBA — shape his approach to entrepreneurship?  \n\n\n## Dinr Competitors\n\n- **HelloFresh** – Subscription-based, backed by Rocket Internet, aggressive growth.  \n- **Gousto** – UK subscription startup, heavy fundraising.  \n- **Middagsfrid (Sweden)** – First mover, sustainability focus.  \n\n**Discussion Prompt:**\n\n- How did Dinr’s *on-demand* positioning differ from subscription-based competitors?  \n- What advantages and risks did this choice create?  \n\n\n<!-- # Turning Point -->\n\n## Early Results\n\n- Initial traction: some enthusiasm, but **low repeat orders** (avg. 1.53).  \n- CAC (£30.4) > CLV.  \n- Customers liked the food, but did not reorder enough.  \n- Berger raised **£60,000 via Seedrs crowdfunding** (2013).  \n\n**Challenge:** Build habit and loyalty in a market dominated by subscription players.  \n\n\n<!-- # Growth Strategy -->\n\n## Relaunch Efforts\n\n- Invested in glossy new website with high-quality food photography.  \n- Hired a culinary intern to create 8 new themed recipes per week.  \n- Added **membership option** (£5/month for 10% discount).  \n- Considered switching to subscription model, but decided against it.  \n\n**Discussion Prompt:**\n\n- Why might Berger have resisted adopting a subscription model?  \n- Would you advise him differently?  \n\n\n## Strategic Dilemma\n\n- **Funding pressures**: Limited runway, failed accelerator applications, reliance on crowdfunding.  \n- **Execution issues**: Tech delays with overseas developers.  \n- **Market pressures**: HelloFresh and Gousto scaling rapidly with large VC rounds.  \n\n**Founder’s Challenge:**  \n\nWhat should Berger do next to attract repeat customers and secure sustainable funding?   \n\n\n## Compare Options\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Stay On-Demand | Differentiates from competitors; flexible for customers | Harder to build loyalty; higher marketing costs |\n| Pivot to Subscription | Recurring revenue; aligns with investor expectations | Competes head-on with better-funded rivals |\n| Hybrid (on-demand + membership) | Offers flexibility + some loyalty | Complex to manage; unclear positioning |  \n\n\n## Make a Recommendation: Which Path?\n\n- **On-Demand**  \n  - Keeps differentiation, but high risk of running out of money.  \n\n- **Subscription**  \n  - Easier to model growth, more attractive to investors.  \n\n- **Hybrid**  \n  - Potential compromise, but resource-intensive for small team.  \n\n\n<!-- # Wrap-Up -->\n\n## Scorecard Totals\n\n- **On-Demand** → ___ / 5  \n- **Subscription** → ___ / 5  \n- **Hybrid** → ___ / 5  \n\n## Discussion Points\n\n- Which growth model makes most sense given Dinr’s resources?  \n- How should Berger balance vision (education + flexibility) with financial realities?  \n- How do customer acquisition and retention metrics drive the decision?  \n\n\n## Exit Strategy\n\n- Berger’s vision: not a billion-dollar business, but a few million in revenue and a solid first startup experience.  \n- Actual outcome: Dinr struggled to scale and eventually shut down, without a formal exit.  \n\n**Discussion Prompt:**  \n\n- What realistic exit strategies could Berger have pursued?  \n  - Acquisition by a larger meal-kit company?  \n  - Building toward a sustainable lifestyle business?  \n  - Positioning for strategic partnerships?  \n- How do the sources of funding (friends/family, crowdfunding) shape the expectations for an exit?  \n- Should founders think about exit strategy from the beginning, or focus first on product–market fit?  \n\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Business model matters**: Revenue structure must match market + investor expectations.  \n- **Execution risk**: Technical delays and founder bandwidth can derail progress.  \n- **Funding challenge**: Crowdfunding offers quick capital, but limited runway.  \n- **Entrepreneurial lesson**: Passion and vision must align with repeatable, scalable economics.  \n\n**What Happened?**\n\n- Dinr ultimately struggled to compete with heavily funded subscription rivals.  \n- Berger later pivoted to other ventures, but the Dinr experience served as his entrepreneurial training ground.  \n\n\n",
