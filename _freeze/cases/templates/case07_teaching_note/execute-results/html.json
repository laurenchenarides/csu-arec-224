(2023), *Sunōmi Switchel: Time to Switch?* — led by **Team E**.  \n2. Focus on two key entrepreneurial decisions:  \n   - Whether to **raise outside capital** or continue **bootstrapping**.  \n   - Whether the founder, **Nikki Blank**, should **stay with Sunōmi or switch careers**.  \n3. Connect case insights to this week’s concepts on **sources of capital**, **entrepreneurial risk**, and **growth trade-offs**.  \n\n\n## Teaching Note for In-Class Framing\n\n**Goal:** Encourage students to see how financing choices reflect not just numbers, but also founder values, risk tolerance, and the realities of scaling a mission-driven venture.  \n\n**Connection to course concepts:**  \n\n- **Week theme:** Sources of Capital and Financing Growth  \n- **Core ideas:** bootstrapping, angel vs. venture capital, debt vs. equity, opportunity cost, and founder–market fit.  \n\n**Discussion anchors:**  \n\n- “What does success mean for Nikki?”  \n- “How should she finance that version of success?”  \n\n\n## Key Terms: Functional Beverage Market\n\n- **Functional Beverage** – Drinks with added health benefits beyond hydration (e.g., gut health, immunity).  \n- **Purchase Occasion** – When and why consumers drink the product (e.g., post-workout, hangover recovery).  \n- **Velocity** – Rate of repeat purchases; the metric retailers use to evaluate performance.  \n- **Co-packing** – Contracting with a third party to manufacture and package your product.  \n- **Working Capital** – Cash needed to fund daily operations (inventory, production, logistics).  \n\n\n> Link to our discussion on **working capital and liquidity constraints**.  \n> “How do working capital needs differ for service vs. product-based ventures?”  \n\n\n\n## Founder’s Perspective\n\n**Role Play Scenario**\n\n- Imagine you are **Nikki Blank**, founder and CEO of Sunōmi Switchel.  \n- You started the business in 2017 after discovering switchel as a healthier alternative to sugary sports drinks.  \n- You bootstrapped the company, produced small runs with co-packers, and built distribution into **Whole Foods, Giant, and Stop & Shop**.  \n- After years of growth and burnout, you face a major decision:  \n  - **Raise capital** to expand or  \n  - **Switch** to a stable career in brand marketing.\n\n**Your goals:**\n\n- Create a successful beverage brand that aligns with your values.  \n- Avoid overextending yourself financially and personally.  \n- Decide what “growth” really means to you.\n\n\n## Sunōmi at a Glance\n\n| Year | Milestone | Key Takeaway |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| 2017 | Founded in D.C., joined GoKitchen accelerator | Gave up 10% equity + board seat for $1 investment |\n| 2018 | Launch at Glen’s Garden Market and Whole Foods | Proof of concept + brand traction |\n| 2019 | Trademark conflict → Rebrand to Sunōmi | Legal & brand management challenge |\n| 2020 | Expanded to Giant and Stop & Shop | Rapid growth, but limited working capital |\n| 2021 | Stalled operations, burnout, job offers elsewhere | Strategic and personal crossroads |\n\n> What does this timeline reveal about the tension between **growth and control**?  \n\n\n## Founder Profile: Nikki Blank\n\n- Background: Journalism + athletics (Tufts University).  \n- Motivation: Replace unhealthy sports drinks with natural alternatives.  \n- Strengths: Brand storytelling, persistence, authentic mission.  \n- Weaknesses: Limited business experience, undercapitalized, emotionally tied to the venture.  \n- External pressures: Family investors, co-founder exit, burnout.\n\n> How do Nikki’s **values and personality** shape her approach to financing?  \n> Compare to last week’s discussion of **entrepreneurial risk tolerance**.\n\n\n## Decision #1: Raise Outside Capital?\n\n**Context:**\n\n- Orders from major retailers (Whole Foods, Giant, Stop & Shop).  \n- Not enough cash to fulfill them.  \n- Estimated need: ~$1.3M for national rollout.\n\n**Options for Funding:**\n\n- **Equity Investment** → Give up ownership for long-term growth capital.  \n- **Debt Financing / Working Capital Loan** → Retain control, but assume repayment risk.  \n- **Continue Bootstrapping** → Maintain independence but risk stagnation.\n\n> Tie this to **Sources of Capital** from lecture:\n- Personal savings / friends & family (initial phase)\n- Angel investors and accelerators (GoKitchen example)\n- Asset-based lending (receivables/inventory-backed loan)\n\n> “How does each funding source shape strategic flexibility?”  \n\n\n\n## Decision #2: Stay or Switch?\n\n| Option | Description | Trade-Off |\n|---------|-------------|------------|\n| **Stay at Sunōmi** | Raise capital, quit job, go full-time | High risk, aligns with purpose, uncertain payoff |\n| **Switch Careers** | Take corporate brand marketing role | Financial stability, less autonomy, end of founder journey |\n\n**Key Question:**  \n\nHow should an entrepreneur decide when to persist vs. pivot?\n\n> Have students apply the **Entrepreneurial Decision Matrix (EDM)**—compare risk, control, return, and alignment with personal goals.\n\n\n## Strategic Dilemmas\n\n- **Financial:** Under-capitalized, strained cash flow, limited runway.  \n- **Operational:** Dependence on co-packers and distributors.  \n- **Market:** Competitive functional beverage space dominated by kombucha and big brands.  \n- **Personal:** Burnout and pressure from family investors.  \n- **Ethical:** Responsibility to repay family loans vs. pursue personal well-being.\n\n> “What non-financial costs do entrepreneurs face when capital is scarce?”  \n> Draw parallels to our in-class exercise on **bootstrapping stress points**.\n\n\n\n## Compare Growth Options\n\n| Strategy | Pros | Cons | Source of Capital |\n|-----------|------|------|------------------|\n| **Raise Equity** | Scale fast, meet retail demand | Lose control, investor pressure | Angel or venture investors |\n| **Take Working Capital Loan** | Maintain control, modest growth | Personal liability, ongoing strain | Asset-based lender |\n| **Bootstrap / Stay Small** | Full autonomy, organic growth | Cash constraint, limited impact | Personal savings, family |\n| **Exit / Switch Careers** | Financial stability, skill development | Ends entrepreneurial dream | N/A |\n\n\n## Class Exercise: The Founder’s Dilemma\n\n> Imagine you are an investor evaluating Sunōmi.  \n> What would you look for before funding Nikki Blank?\n\nDiscuss:\n\n1. What signals show founder readiness?  \n2. What financials or traction would you need to see?  \n3. Would you invest — and if so, under what terms?  \n\n> This connects to the **entrepreneur–investor relationship** we discussed: alignment of values, vision, and risk appetite.\n\n\n\n## Discussion Questions\n\n1. What financing path best fits Nikki’s goals and constraints?  \n2. How do her financing choices shape control, risk, and growth potential?  \n3. How might her **burnout** influence rational decision-making?  \n4. Should she prioritize **repaying her family** or **protecting her own wellbeing**?  \n5. What lessons about **capital structure** and **personal sustainability** can entrepreneurs learn from Sunōmi?\n\n\n## Scorecard Exercise\n\n| Option | Founder Fit (1–5) | Financial Viability (1–5) | Market Potential (1–5) | Mission Alignment (1–5) | Total |\n|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------|\n| Raise Investor Capital | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| Take Working Loan | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| Continue Bootstrapping | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| Exit / Switch Careers | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n\nAfter scoring each option, **defend your recommendation** in a short summary.\n\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Bootstrapping Builds Discipline:** But limits scale and speed.  \n- **Control vs. Capital Trade-Off:** Every funding source affects autonomy and mission.  \n- **Founder–Market Fit:** Passion matters, but stamina and systems matter too.  \n- **Financial Literacy:** Understanding debt, equity, and working capital is vital for growth.  \n- **Sustainability:** Success also means knowing when to pivot or pause.  \n\n\n## What Happened?\n\n- Sunōmi continued small-scale regional distribution but never scaled nationally.  \n- Nikki Blank transitioned into a brand marketing role while keeping Sunōmi active online.  \n- Her experience is now used in entrepreneurship programs as a model of **founder self-awareness** and **values-driven decision-making**.\n\n\n> Emphasize that *success in entrepreneurship is multidimensional* — sometimes stepping away is a strategic decision, not a failure.\n",
