Determines “runway” before new funding is needed.  \n- **Runway** – Number of months before the company runs out of cash at current burn rate.  \n- **Product–Market Fit** – When a product meets a strong market demand and growth accelerates naturally.  \n- **Culture Fit** – Hiring/management emphasis on values and alignment with company mission.  \n\n\n# Framing the Case\n\n## Founder’s Perspective\n\n**Role Play**\n\n- Imagine you are **Tracy Lawrence, co-founder and CEO of Chewse**.  \n- Your goals:  \n  - Scale the business beyond San Francisco.  \n  - Preserve the **“Love Culture”** that differentiates Chewse.  \n  - Secure the right investors and leaders for growth.  \n\n**Key Question:**  \n\nHow do you expand Chewse without losing its culture?  \n\n# Case Overview\n\n## Chewse at a Glance\n\n- Founded by **Tracy Lawrence** (2011) after frustrations with catering logistics.  \n- Pivoted from event catering to **corporate lunch delivery**.  \n- Completed **500 Startups** accelerator → refined focus on office meals.  \n- Differentiation:  \n  - Simplified catering management.  \n  - Curated local restaurant partners.  \n  - **Culture factor**: mealtime hosts to build community.  \n\n**Mission:** “Make sure nobody eats alone.”  \n\n## Chewse’s “Love Culture”\n\n- Emphasis on **relationships, transparency, and vulnerability**.  \n- Practices include:  \n  - **Open salaries**.  \n  - **Weekly gratitude circles**.  \n  - Hiring based on **values fit**.  \n  - Transitioned delivery staff to employees.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Discussion Prompt\"}\n- What advantages does this culture create?  \n- What risks does it carry for growth and fundraising?  \n:::\n\n# Turning Point\n\n## Investor Pushback\n\n- Some investors dismissed Tracy for not being “out for blood.”  \n- Lawrence reframed: Chewse isn’t “out for blood” — it’s **“out for love.”**  \n- Raised **$5.6M Series A** with Foundry Group (B Corp) + others.  \n\n**Tension:** Culture as a liability vs. culture as a strategic advantage.  \n\n# Growth Strategy\n\n## Fast vs. Slow Growth\n\n**Fast Growth**  \n- First-mover advantage.  \n- Access untapped markets quickly.  \n- Attracts more venture capital.  \n- Can recruit top talent.  \n- Higher liquidity (potential exit sooner).  \n\n**Slow Growth**  \n- More sustainable over time.  \n- Easier to maintain culture.  \n- Lower employee churn.  \n- Easier to pivot if needed.  \n- Builds trust in the brand.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Discussion Prompt\"}\nWhy might Tracy Lawrence have chosen a slower growth path for Chewse?  \nHow does this choice shape the Seattle vs. Los Angeles decision?  \n:::\n\n# Strategic Dilemma\n\n## Next Market Expansion\n\nChewse must decide where to expand after San Francisco:\n\n- **Seattle**  \n  - Similar to SF in size and customer profile.  \n  - Safer bet for transferring culture.  \n\n- **Los Angeles**  \n  - Larger, more complex market.  \n  - Less tech-centric, more influential industries (banking, entertainment).  \n\n**Founder’s Challenge:**  \n\nAs Tracy, should you choose the safer option (Seattle) or the bold move (LA) — and how will you maintain *Love Culture* in a new city?   \n\n# Compare Options\n\n## Expansion Criteria\n\n**Market similarity** – Is it easier to replicate SF’s success?  \n\n**Cultural transferability** – Can Tracy embed Chewse’s *Love Culture* in this new city?  \n\n**Growth potential** – Will this market support fundraising and visibility?  \n\n**Team building** – Will Tracy find (or promote) leaders who embody our values?  \n\n**Operational feasibility** – Is this market manageable in terms of geography and logistics?   \n\n**Strategic fit** – Does the expansion reinforce mission + business model?  \n\n**Strategic visibility** – Will this market choice strengthen Chewse’s credibility for future fundraising?  \n\n**Personal bandwidth** – How much time will be needed to spend there to get it right?  \n\n# Apply the Criteria\n\n## Expansion Tradeoffs\n\n| Founder’s Criteria                      | Seattle                        | Los Angeles                    |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Can Love Culture be transferred easily? | [ ] Similar culture to SF        | [ ] Different culture, riskier   |\n| Can I build the right team quickly?     | [ ] Smaller, easier to manage    | [ ] Larger, more talent diversity|\n| Are operations/logistics manageable?    | [ ] Compact city, tech hub       | [ ] Sprawl + heavy traffic       |\n| Do I have bandwidth to support it?      | [ ] Less demanding travel        | [ ] More personal time required  |\n| Will this market boost our credibility? | [ ] Safer but less visible choice| [ ] Bold, influential industries |\n\n**Instructions**\n\n- Check boxes as you evaluate each city through Tracy’s eyes.  \n- Discuss: Which criteria should matter most to her at this stage?  \n\n# Make a Recommendation\n\n## Which Market?\n\n- **Seattle**  \n  - Lower risk, culturally similar, manageable geography.  \n  - But may be seen as a “safe” or less ambitious choice.  \n\n- **Los Angeles**  \n  - Bigger market, more diverse industries, higher visibility.  \n  - But logistics + cultural differences pose challenges.  \n\n# Wrap-Up\n\n## Scorecard Totals\n\n- **Seattle** → ___ / 5  \n- **Los Angeles** → ___ / 5  \n\n## Discussion Points\n\n- Which criteria did your group weigh most heavily?  \n- How does Chewse’s **love culture** factor into your choice?  \n- Are you evaluating purely on strategy, or also on values?  \n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Culture as strategy**: Chewse’s differentiation goes beyond food.  \n- **Growth dilemma**: Expansion involves both markets and values.  \n- **No single answer**: Seattle vs. LA highlights different growth philosophies.  \n- **Entrepreneurial lesson**: Mission-driven businesses must balance heart and scale.  \n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"What Happened?\"}\nChewse ultimately re-entered **Los Angeles**, prioritizing influence and proving culture could work outside of tech.  \n:::\n",
