Share the strength statements you wrote about yourself.\\\n2. Give feedback:\\\n- Which characteristic came across most clearly?\\\n- Which one could use a stronger example?\\\n3. Write down one idea from your partner you want to add to your own brag sheet.\n\n## Step 5: Wrap-Up (5 minutes)\n\nThink ahead: if you asked your mentor for a letter at the end of the semester,\\\n- What would you want them to highlight?\\\n- How will you show evidence of your characteristics so they can?\n\n*(Write 2–3 bullet points as an action reminder for yourself.)*\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Recall: Entrepreneurial Characteristics\n\n| Characteristic | Description |\n|:----------------------|:------------------------------------------------|\n| Calculated Risk Taking | Makes strategic, informed decisions about when to take a risk, not reckless. |\n| Communication | Effectively conveys ideas and actively listens in professional settings. |\n| Creativity and Innovativeness | Generates original ideas and sees possibilities others may not. |\n| Determination and Perseverance | Total dedication to success, overcoming obstacles and setbacks, unwavering commitment to succeed. |\n| Drive to Achieve | A strong desire to compete, to excel against self-imposed standards, to pursue challenging goals. |\n| Entrepreneurial Coachability | Seeks, integrates, and learns from failures, setbacks, or feedback to grow. |\n| Entrepreneurial Hustle | Acts with urgency and creativity to solve immediate problems. |\n| High Energy Level | Demonstrates consistent drive and enthusiasm to sustain effort over time. |\n| Opportunity Orientation | Focuses on opportunity rather than resources; always scanning for possibilities. |\n| Passion | Demonstrates deep emotional investment in the work. |\n| Persistent Problem Solving | Tackles tough problems with a methodical, realistic approach; doesn’t quit easily. |\n| Personal Agency (Internal Locus of Control) | Believes success comes from personal responsibility and effort, not luck. |\n| Seeking Feedback | Actively looks for input to improve performance; learns from critique. |\n| Team Building | Builds strong, motivated teams; values others' strengths. |\n| Tolerance for Ambiguity | Comfortable operating under uncertainty or limited structure. |\n| Vision | Has a clear sense of purpose or long-term direction. |\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Use This Page For Writing",
